Carlos Tuimavave and Fetuli Talanoa tries and a Jake Connor penalty gave Hull a 14-12 half-time lead, Cas' Ben Roberts and Zak Hardaker replying.
Connor kicked three more penalties and Roberts crossed again before Hull pulled away when Mahe Fonua and Jamie Shaul scored within two minutes.
Greg Minikin's late try set up a tense finish but Hull's defence stood strong.
Hull's victory set up a semi-final with Leeds Rhinos, while Wigan Warriors, winners against rivals Warrington on Saturday, face Salford Red Devils.
The defeat was only the Tigers' fourth of the season, having won eight successive matches going into the game, with their last loss also coming against Lee Radford's side.
The hosts had flown into a 12-0 lead early on when Tuimavave intercepted a pass to run nearly the full length of the pitch before Talanoa muscled off two defenders to cross.
But Roberts showed fleet of foot to find a gap and score, while Hardaker touched down Luke Gale's smart kick.
Connor's penalty kept Hull in the driving seat, and his kicks kept the score ticking over in the second, as Roberts once more found a gap to get his second try.
But Hull took a firm grip on the match thanks to two quickfire tries, and although Minikin barrelled his way through down the right, Cas' handling mistakes throughout the match came back to haunt them.
Hull head coach Lee Radford:
"I'm very proud of my players. There were plenty of special efforts and that was needed.
"This is the juicy part of the season, the excitement starts now.
"Leeds will be a tough semi-final. I don't think we've beaten them in nine games so it will be a challenging and tough Yorkshire derby. But these are the exciting game to be involved in."
Castleford boss Daryl Powell:
"Obviously I'm disappointed because it was a poor performance. We didn't handle the start well but we battled back well and we thought we could resettle at half-time.

===Input Doc/Src: Actions required to meet that target have been set out in a study for WWF Scotland, Friends of the Earth Scotland and RSPB Scotland.
The environmental groups have now called on the Scottish government to bring forward the necessary policies.
Ministers said the report was a "useful contribution" to the energy debate.
The report, based on independent analysis by Ricardo Energy and Environment, is called "The Energy of Scotland: Heating, moving and powering our lives from now to 2030".
It sets out how Scotland's climate targets could be met in "the most cost-effective way".
It found that to achieve these goals, half of all the country's energy will need to come from renewables by the end of the next decade.
The report suggested that by 2030:
It said other benefits would include the "creation of new jobs; warmer, healthier homes; and cleaner air helping reduce the burden on the NHS".
WWF Scotland director Lang Banks said: "This report shows that a 50% renewables target for all our energy needs by 2030 is not only needed, but that it is achievable.
"Ministers should now make this a Scottish government target and bring in the policies needed in its forthcoming energy strategy.
"Doing so would enable Scotland to enjoy the many economic and social benefits that the report suggests would take place as result of generating half of all our energy needs from renewables.
"Scotland is already seeing the economic and social benefits of shifting our electricity system to clean, climate-friendly, renewables generation."
He added: "However, with electricity accounting for just one quarter of our energy use, it's time to begin to reap the same benefits by increasing the use of renewables in our heat and transport sectors."
The Scottish government has already achieved a target to reduce emissions by at least 42% by 2020.
It also aims to generate 100% of Scotland's electricity from renewable sources by 2020.

===Input Doc/Src: To protect your email, social networking accounts and the rest of your online life, strong passwords are essential.
But setting and remembering it can be as easy as singing your favourite song.
Here's our step-by-step guide to how lyrics can help you stay safe online.
We'll pick the Foo Fighters, because they're generally great. But it could be anyone you like, or U2. As long as you can remember some of the lyrics to one of their songs.
The catchier the better, to make sure you can remember those words. Something from Nothing seems like a good track to go for, fresh from the Foo's new album Sonic Highways.
It could be the chorus or the bit you like the most. We've gone for the opening lines: "Give me the flammable life, I'm cold as a match." Sing it, Dave.
Take the first letter of each word to make the basis of your password. That gives us GMTFLICAAM. Not bad, but it could someone who knows your music taste possibly guess it?
Mix lower and upper case letters to make the password a little harder to guess. You should end up with something like: GmTFLICaam
Swapping letters for numbers and symbols can make your password even more difficult to guess. So, a capital G looks a bit like 6, we'll swap F for 4 because four begins with f, L and I both look like 1s so that's an easy swap. The @ signs are a good alternative to the letter a. It probably goes without saying, but ours is just an example and not one you should use. Stay safe!

===Input Doc/Src: The Netherlands currently lead Namibia and Ireland by six points.
Batsmen William Porterfield and Ed Joyce return after being rested for the four-day tour game against Zimbabwe A.
Paul Stirling is also expected to take his place in the team after recovering from tightness in his quad.
Stirling did not bat in the final innings of Ireland's draw with Zimbabwe A as a precautionary measure.
Porterfield and Joyce instead spent time batting in the nets and both are expected to play, as is bowler Tim Murtagh, who was also rested.
In the potential scenario of the side winning the match after conceding a first innings lead, the Dutch will drop to third as in this situation the side that wins the match will collect 13 points while the side that claims the first innings lead will get seven points.
Namibia have been preparing for the game by playing in South African domestic cricket, while Ireland arrived in Windhoek directly from Harare, where they have spent the last three weeks playing three one-day internationals and a four-day match with Zimbabwe A.
In the first round of fixtures, reigning champions Ireland defeated the United Arab Emirates by an innings and 26 runs in Malahide in June, while Namibia recorded a 114-run victory over Hong Kong in May and will be aiming to make home advantage count against Porterfield's experienced side.
There has been one change to the original 14-man squad named by Ireland, with Max Sorensen returning home from Zimbabwe with a back injury, the impressive Stuart Poynter comes into the squad in his place.
Poynter goes into the match on the back of scoring his maiden first-class century in the final tour match in Harare, while Stirling, Gary Wilson, Kevin O'Brien, John Mooney and Niall O'Brien all made half-centuries in Zimbabwe.
With conditions at the Wanderers Club very similar to those in Zimbabwe, Ireland are well acclimatised and required the minimal recovery time after their travel day to Windhoek.

===Input Doc/Src: The coach, which was carrying a cheerleading team from Kent, collided with an Audi car near Flitwick at 06:45 GMT.
Two men from Buckinghamshire and a third from the London area, all of whom were in the car, died.
A fourth man, who was also in the car, has been taken to Oxford's John Radcliffe Hospital.
No-one on the coach was injured.
Bedfordshire Police said the double-decker coach collided with the Audi while it was stationary on the hard shoulder.
"The coach driver was arrested in connection with the incident and taken to Luton Police Station where he is being interviewed," a police spokesman said.
It is understood the cheerleading team are from a university in Kent and were on their way to a sporting event in Birmingham when the crash happened.
Tim Lambkin, director of Sheerness-based Travelmasters, said the cheerleaders were transferred to another vehicle and continued on their way after the collision.
Mr Lambkin said: "It is too soon to comment on the causes of what happened - we have to let the police experts do their work.
"Our hearts and thoughts go out to the families of those who died and the man hurt.

The review will be published at 11:00 BST and details of anyone earning more than £150,000 a year will be included.
The report will also look at TV and radio viewing figures, as well as online engagement.
It may also examine the issue of the competition, such as Netflix.
It looks back over the previous year's performance and publishes details about the corporation's finances and spending. This year's edition could prove more interesting than most.
It's all down to the government's culture secretary, Karen Bradley.
Speaking in the House of Commons last September, Mrs Bradley said publishing the salaries of stars earning more than £150,000 would bring the BBC "in line with the civil service" on transparency.
The culture secretary said it would help ensure the BBC "produces value for money for the licence fee" and that more transparency could lead to savings that could be "invested in even more great programmes".
But the BBC's director general, Tony Hall, has said: "Our position on talent pay has not changed and all major broadcasters have questioned the merit of the proposal.
"The BBC operates in a competitive market and this will not make it easier for the BBC to retain the talent the public love."
ITV's programmes chief, Kevin Lygo, also called the proposal a "mean-spirited, nosey way of looking at things" during last year's Edinburgh Television Festival.
The corporation already reveals the salary details of on-air stars who earn more than £450,000 and executives who earn more than £150,000.
Presenters such as Graham Norton, Gary Lineker, Claudia Winkleman, Chris Evans, Fiona Bruce and Andrew Marr could easily be on the list.
The revelations are required under the BBC's new Royal Charter, and are expected to encompass more than 100 of its top stars.

===Input Doc/Src: The watercolour, attributed to Queen Victoria's favourite artist Sir Edwin Landseer, was sold by JP Humbert of Whittlebury, Northamptonshire.
The painting has attracted both firm supporters and those who doubt whether it does depict the Brontes.
It was sold to a collector who plans to do more research and resell it.
Bidding took off just 15 minutes before the end of the "timed" online auction with the painting sold for £40,550 hammer price (£50,038 including buyers premium) to an private investor believed to be based in the UK.
Auctioneer Jonathan Humbert said: "We are very pleased our theory has been accepted and endorsed by the establishment.
"The evidence was compelling that this is the Brontes as painted by Landseer and its successful sale has proved that research and factual evidence will overcome apathy and negativity."
Mr Humbert had decided to pull the picture, which he believes to be of "national importance", from an auction in 2012 so more research could be done.
Landseer was a popular Victorian painter best known for his animal portraits and designing the bronze lions in London's Trafalgar Square.
The Bronte family moved to Haworth, West Yorkshire, in 1820 where the Reverend Patrick Bronte was appointed Curate of Haworth.
They lived at the Haworth Parsonage from 1820 to 1861, which is now the Bronte Parsonage Museum.

===Input Doc/Src: Groups of tourists, fresh off the ferry from Cape Town, pass by with barely a glance.
But for Mr Mandela, the garden held a special value. And if you stand inside the tiny cell where South Africa's struggle icon spent 18 years hidden from the world, and peer through the barred window into the high-walled courtyard, you can just make out the thin strip of green and brown foliage where he once tended tomatoes and chillies.
"A garden was one of the few things in prison that one could controlâ€¦ The sense of being the custodian of this small patch of earth offered a small taste of freedom," Mr Mandela wrote in his autobiography, Long Walk To Freedom - an early draft of which, incidentally, he tried to hide from the prison guards by burying in the garden.
Today, the garden's weeds - and the rotting stump of an apple tree - hint at the alleged mismanagement and corruption that have blighted Robben Island for years.
But along one wall, two grape vines now stand out in sharp contrast - the lush green foliage of a promising harvest suspended on a wooden frame.
"They're still growing, thriving, regardless of the difficult conditions on the island. They're very much a symbol of the resilience of the leaders imprisoned here," said Philip Jonker, a South African wine maker as he and two colleagues carefully pruned the vines by hand.
It is seven years since Mr Jonker first spotted the two plants on a family visit to the island.
It is not clear whether Mr Mandela himself tended the vines or whether, as seems more likely, they were planted shortly after he was transferred to another prison on the mainland. But Mr Jonker sees them - there are seven vines around the prison in total - as part of the island's heritage, and a way of preserving "South African history in a bottle".
After four years of petitioning, he finally secured permission to tend the vines, and, last year, to take the first harvest - previous ones had been devoured by the island's ravenous birds - back to his Weltevr

If I had told anyone, I would have been belted or got the strap, he said.
Castledare orphanage near Perth, run by the Christian Brothers order, was like "a legal paedophile ring", he said.
The witness told the inquiry: "If someone did it in the public eye, he'd go to court, he'd get sentenced and he'd serve time.
"If he'd got a habit on, if you're a Christian Brother then it seemed to be a free-for-all.
"We knew what would happen if you told somebody, especially in authority, they would say 'this doesn't happen here.'"

He went on to claim that Brother Murphy was later "transferred from place to place" to effectively hide him.
He said his time at the orphanage still haunted him and was "probably something I will never forget".
He had bottled it up for nearly 30 years and had only chosen to speak out when he found out about the inquiry, he added.
Life for the orphans involved hard physical labour including pulling down trees, clearing land, digging out a swimming pool and building a handball court by chipping bricks.
"You had to chip X amount of bricks before you can knock off, before you had something to eat," he told the inquiry, which is looking into abuse in England and Wales.
The boys wore only a grey shirt and shorts, no matter what the weather, he said.
There were no underpants and shoes were only worn when somebody important visited, otherwise feet were bare, he added.
Brothers would be fully clothed with shoes and gloves while the boys shivered in the cold, he said.
The inquiry also heard from another former child migrant, Oliver Cosgrove, who is now in his late sixties and who also lived at Castledare.
He said the Christian Brothers, who ran the home, would visit the children's beds at night.

Its report, written with Age UK, was based on 161 patients and 57 staff completing questionnaires, as well as six focus groups and 10 case studies.
The majority of patients were still treated with dignity, the report added.
Patients with communication difficulties and dementia were particularly unhappy with their care.
One patient, who had suffered a stroke, said she was left for hours in her own excrement.
She said: "I was sedated and my health needs were neglected."
Another described finding her mother-in-law, who has Alzheimer's, "soaked, dirty" and ignored by nurses.
Their report said that, in a small number of cases, their experiences were "shocking".
A woman who suffers from trigeminal neuralgia, a condition which causes severe facial pain, said that while she was normally treated with respect, on one occasion she was called "unclean" by a staff member when she was in too much pain to wash.
Healthwatch also found people were often reluctant to complain and did not always feel properly involved in decisions about their care.
But 93% of patients who responded said they had been treated with dignity or respect "some of the time", "most of the time" or "always".
While patients were receiving "a high level of dignity in their care", Healthwatch chief executive Rachel Coney said there was "still much that can be improved about how people are treated".
The report, written in partnership with charity Age UK, said the county's care organisations have made commitments to improve.
These include drawing up formal dignity standards, reviewing staff training, and involving patients more in decision making.

The secretary of state added he was going forward with "positive intent" but that "differences firmly do remain".
"My priority is to see the restoration of the devolved institutions in Northern Ireland, working on a sustainable basis to deliver good government for everyone," Mr Brokenshire said.
Mr Brokenshire said: "Over the summer I have kept in touch with the political parties and I will be bringing them together over the next week as we enter a new phase of talks.
"Urgent progress is required. The lack of an executive making key decisions on matters including health and education means that public services in Northern Ireland are suffering.
"We need to find a way forward that will allow an executive to be formed."
Mr Coveney said he planned to visit Belfast next week to meet politicians.
"Northern Ireland needs a voice through a government of its own," he said. "We need to see a resumption to those discussions and hopefully a conclusion as soon as possible.
"We don't want talks that are ongoing for a long period of time."

However, striker Fernando Llorente opted for Tottenham instead of a move to Stamford Bridge.
And Everton midfielder Ross Barkley changed his mind about joining Antonio Conte's side.
Leicester expect to confirm the signing of Adrien Silva, 28, from Sporting Lisbon on Friday for £22m as a midfield replacement.
Drinkwater played in 35 of Leicester's 38 league games in their title-winning season and formed an impressive midfield partnership with N'Golo Kante, who joined Chelsea last July.
He has yet to play this season because of a thigh injury.
The playmaker, who joined Leicester in 2012 from Manchester United, has won three England caps since making his international debut in March 2016.
"I'm delighted to be a Chelsea player and can't wait to get started," said Drinkwater. "It has been a long journey to get here but I am very happy and am looking forward to helping the club win more trophies."
Zappacosta has been capped four times by Italy, with Blues boss Conte handing him his first call-up to the national squad in May 2016.

===Input Doc/Src: Dayow Mohamed Hassan, 44, was buried neck-deep and pelted to death with stones by al-Shabab fighters.
He was convicted of being in an adulterous relationship with a woman and impregnating her, despite having two wives, an official said.
Al-Shabab occasionally passes such sentences for sexual offences in areas it controls in Somalia.
In 2014, a teenage boy was stoned to death after being convicted of raping a woman.
In 2008, a young girl was killed in a similar manner after being convicted of adultery.
In the latest case, a  woman filed a complaint of rape against Hassan, but the court tried him for adultery as it is easier to prove, says BBC Somali's Mohamed Mohamed.
Hundreds of people watched him being stoned death in Ramo Adey village in the south-central Bay region, said Moalim Geedow, the al-Shabab governor for the area.
"The man had a third woman who was a divorcee... He deceived her, saying that he went to a sheikh [religious leader] and that he married her," Mr Geedow told Reuters news agency.
"However, when the woman got pregnant, the two families debated and there was no trace of valid matrimony. The court ruled he did not marry her legally and he was stoned to death."
Al-Shabab is fighting to overthrow the weak UN-backed government in Somalia and impose its own strict interpretation of Islamic law.
It has lost control of many towns and cities to a 22,000-strong African Union force supporting the government.
But the group, linked to al-Qaeda, still has a strong presence in many rural areas.

"At the minute we've got nearly £2,000 and if we beat Hartlepool in the next round I'll be saying to the chairman I want another £5,000 to go into that players' pot.
"That's our goal, our dream, to send the boys to America."
Drury, who led Conference North side Corby Town into the first round of the FA Cup five years ago, took over as manager of Stamford last season but was unable to save them from relegation from the Northern Premier League Premier Division.
And he said was delighted to make club history by giving them some cup success.

===Input Doc/Src: So often repeated are the words of the Swedish diplomat Dag Hammarskjold, the organisation's most beloved secretary general, they have come to serve as a mission statement of sorts.
Additionally, they function as a crude benchmark against which the work of the United Nations can be judged.
When the organisation was formed in 1945, in the aftermath of World War Two and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, "hell" would have been the outbreak of a third global conflict and nuclear Armageddon, neither of which has come to pass.
But in those post-War years, as the full horror of the Holocaust was uncovered, "hell" also meant genocide, a word which had only just been coined: the systematic massacre of thousands of people because of their ethnicity, religion, race or nationality.
Here, the UN has not always been able to halt the descent into the abyss.
To its member states' eternal shame, on some occasions it has been a bystander to genocide.
In any historical ledger, Rwanda and Srebrenica stand out as ghastly failures.
During the Rwanda genocide, UN peacekeepers deployed in the country concentrated on evacuating expatriates and government officials, failing to intervene as 800,000 Tutsis and sympathetic Hutus were slaughtered.
In Srebrenica in July 1995, more than 8,000 Muslims, mainly men and boys, were massacred by Bosnian Serb forces, which barged past Dutch soldiers wearing the distinctive blue helmet of the UN peacekeepers as if they weren't there.
What made the massacre all the more horrifying was that the Muslims had sheltered in enclaves deemed "safe areas" under the protections of the UN.
In some conflicts, such as Yugoslavia, the UN was slow to respond.
In others, such as Vietnam and the Iraq war, it was sidelined.
Its efforts to broker peace talks during Syria's civil war, now in its fifth year, have always ended in failure.
Now, a third UN envoy, the Italian diplomat Staffan de Mistura, is trying, without success so far, to break the impasse.

===Input Doc/Src: More mothers now need surgery to deliver a baby due to their narrow pelvis size, according to a study.
Researchers estimate cases where the baby cannot fit down the birth canal have increased from 30 in 1,000 in the 1960s to 36 in 1,000 births today.
Historically, these genes would not have been passed from mother to child as both would have died in labour.
Researchers in Austria say the trend is likely to continue, but not to the extent that non-surgical births will become obsolete.
Dr Philipp Mitteroecker, of the department of theoretical biology at the University of Vienna, said there was a long standing question in the understanding of human evolution.
"Why is the rate of birth problems, in particular what we call fetopelvic disproportion - basically that the baby doesn't fit through the maternal birth canal - why is this rate so high?" he said.
"Without modern medical intervention such problems often were lethal and this is, from an evolutionary perspective, selection.
"Women with a very narrow pelvis would not have survived birth 100 years ago. They do now and pass on their genes encoding for a narrow pelvis to their daughters."
It has been a long standing evolutionary question why the human pelvis has not grown wider over the years.
The head of a human baby is large compared with other primates, meaning animals such as chimps can give birth relatively easily.
The researchers devised a mathematical model using data from the World Health Organization and other large birth studies.
They found opposing evolutionary forces in their theoretical study.
One is a trend towards larger newborns, which are more healthy.
However, if they grow too large, they get stuck during labour, which historically would have proved disastrous for mother and baby, and their genes would not be passed on.
"One side of this selective force - namely the trend towards smaller babies - has vanished due to Caesarean sections," said Dr Mitteroecker.
"Our intent is not to criticise medical inte

===Input Doc/Src: Zia Haider Rahman's critically acclaimed debut, In the Light of What We Know, picked up the James Tait Black fiction prize on Monday evening.
The Valley: A Hundred Years in the Life of a Yorkshire Family by Richard Benson won the biography prize.
The two prizes are awarded annually by the University of Edinburgh.
Chairman of the James Tait Black Prize for fiction, Professor Randall Stevenson, said of the winning fiction entry: "Zia Haider Rahman addresses a whole range of issues - the war in Afghanistan, the rise of Muslim fundamentalism and the banking crisis.
"Moreover, he also explores problematic areas of politics and finance, which are often exiled from the pages of fiction, immersing his readers, dauntingly but comprehensibly.
"The novel's impressive scope is complemented by Rahman's ability to locate the personal in the political."
Benson's The Valley: A Hundred Years in the Life of a Yorkshire Family, sees the author draw on his own family history set in a mining community.
Biography judge Dr Jonathan Wild said: "Richard Benson's book represents a remarkable reclamation of a once prevalent social group now almost entirely gone."
Each winner receives Â£10,000 each in prize money.
The James Tait Black Awards were founded in 1919 by Janet Coats, the widow of publisher James Tait Black, to commemorate her husband's love for books.
Previous winners include DH Lawrence, Graham Greene, Angela Carter and Ian McEwan.

===Input Doc/Src: Mrs Clinton is the highest-ranking US official to visit South Sudan since it gained independence last July.
A UN deadline for the nations to resolve disputes over their border and oil transit fees passed on Thursday.
South Sudan is the second stop of Mrs Clinton's seven-country African tour.
The row over oil has led to huge economic problems in both countries - South Sudan has suspended all oil production, accusing Khartoum of stealing its exports, while austerity measures have sparked weeks of protests in Khartoum.
"We need to get those [oil] resources flowing again," Mrs Clinton told reporters after talks lasting more than an hour with South Sudanese President Salva Kiir.
"A percentage of something is better than a percentage of nothing," she said, according to the Reuters news agency.
At independence, the South took three-quarters of Sudan's oil with it but all the pipelines still flow north.
"While South Sudan and Sudan have become separate states, their fortunes and their futures remain inextricably linked," Mrs Clinton said.
"Both countries will need to compromise to close the remaining gaps between them."
Ms Clinton's visit to South Sudan came nearly a month after the new state celebrated its first anniversary of independence, which was brought about by a 2005 peace deal between Sudan and the then southern rebels.
The two countries came close to all-out war in April, when South Sudanese troops briefly occupied the disputed oil-rich border area of Heglig.
Negotiations between the two countries in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, aimed at resolving all outstanding issues, are currently stalled.
Arriving from Senegal via the Ugandan capital Kampala, Mrs Clinton spent only a few hours in Juba before returning to Uganda.
Remarks by Mrs Clinton in Senegal which seemed to criticise China's involvement in Africa were met with a stinging rebuke by the Chinese state media on Friday.

Last year the management was replaced as part of an overhaul ordered by the Pope to stamp out corruption.
The bank has promised to improve its returns to customers.
"The main focus is on fundamentally improving our overall client service standards and further professionalising our asset management services," IOR chairman Jean-Baptiste de Franssu said in a statement.
As part of the overhaul, the bank pledged to screen all its accounts, bringing in anti-money laundering experts to carry out the task. As a result it has closed more than 4,000 accounts since May 2013, most of which were dormant, but 554 of which were closed because they did not meet the bank's new standards for clients.

===Input Doc/Src: York's National Railway Museum (NRM) has launched an appeal to mark the Flying Scotsman's 93rd birthday.
The engine, which retired from service in 1963, has been restored for the NRM in a decade-long, £4.2m refit.
On Saturday it ventured on to the mainline network for the first time in 40 years as it took a test run through Cumbria and Lancashire.
Last month, the locomotive emerged into the East Lancashire Railway's Bury Bolton Street station after the final stages of the work at a nearby yard, thrilling hundreds of rail enthusiasts.
It is due to be painted in its new green livery on Wednesday and have its nameplates reattached before making its journey between London Kings Cross and York on 25 February.
Public services will begin later this month, alongside an exhibition at the museum.
Former fireman John Morgan, from Peterborough, said he was looking forward to seeing the Flying Scotsman steaming between the two cities again.
The 77-year-old became a fireman at 16 and worked on some of the most famous locomotives of the age, including the Flying Scotsman and the Mallard, the world's fastest steam train.
"I have a lot of very good memories of 60103 [Flying Scotsman's British Rail number]," he said.
"I did a lot of trips on the footplate and shovelled a lot of coal.
"There was a lot of interest, even back then. Whenever we'd back up into King's Cross there'd be a crowd of people around wanting to get up into the cab."
Bob Gwynne, associate curator of collections and research at the NRM, said: "As we've been planning our highly anticipated Scotsman Season, many people have already approached us with their special connections to the iconic steam locomotive and the famous train it was named after.
"We've heard from crew members that worked on board and their families, and even of some babies born on the train."

===Input Doc/Src: The picture sees 163 of this year's nominees gathered together and smiling away, but zoom in and there is a whole lot more going on.
Here are just seven of the things we spotted in this year's photo.
1. Pharrell Williams didn't exactly dress for the occasion
All of this year's male nominees are dressed smartly in tuxes and suits. Well, almost all.
The "dress code" memo must have gone into Pharrell's junk email inbox, because he turned up wearing a green baseball cap and grey sweater.
To be fair - the sweater does have the Nasa logo on it, a reference to best picture nominee Hidden Figures.
Pharrell wrote several songs for the soundtrack to the film, which tells the story of three African-American women who worked behind the scenes at the space agency in the 1960s.
2. Michelle Williams is upstaged by Casey Affleck's facial hair
Casey Affleck's facial hair is fast becoming the eighth wonder of the world. It gets longer with every awards ceremony he appears at this season.
It's now on the verge of totally eclipsing poor Michelle Williams, Affleck's co-star in Manchester by the Sea, who has to peep out from behind his mane.
She must be used to Affleck stealing her limelight.
The actor appears in nearly every scene in the 137-minute movie, while Williams's screen time clocks in at 11 minutes.
3. The writer of Moonlight wants you to know how many nominations it has
Tarell Alvin McCraney brightens up the back row of the photograph with his winning smile.
He's the man behind the stage play In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue - which went on to become Moonlight, one of this year's most hotly-tipped Oscars contenders.
McCraney is so pleased with the film's success he wants to let you know just how many Oscar nominations the film has received, and he is seen here holding up eight fingers.
(There is, of course, another explanation. He could be making the "305" hand gesture - which is the area code for Miami-Dade county, his home and the place where Moonlight is set.)

===Input Doc/Src: Lewis Elliot, 19, predicted both teams would score in both halves of the Crawley v Carlisle, Hibernian v Aberdeen and Chelsea v Tottenham games.
The bet came in at odds of 6,858/1 when Eden Hazard scored for Chelsea in their FA Cup semi-final.
"I am absolutely delighted," said Mr Elliot. "I went crazy when Hazard scored."
The first two legs of his bet came in as Aberdeen reached the Scottish Cup final with a 3-2 win over Hibs.
Later, Crawley and Carlisle shared the spoils in a 3-3 draw in League Two.
Mr Elliot's win was confirmed at Wembley on Saturday evening, with Chelsea's Willian and Spurs' Harry Kane scoring in the first half of the two London sides' cup clash.
Dele Alli scored for Tottenham just after the break to leave Lewis requiring just one more Chelsea goal to land his bumper bet.
That goal came courtesy of Eden Hazard, who scored in the 75th minute to give the Blues the lead and send them on their way to the FA Cup final.

Tony Butler, the BPA's chief operating officer, is leading the probe into the death and said it was his "top priority".
He estimated it would take about a month to complete his investigation and he would send his findings to the Civil Aviation Authority, the police and the coroner as well as the BPA's training committee.

Darren McCurry and Peter Harte led the charge with a combined total of 10 points as the Red Hands recovered from a slow start to triumph at Clones.
Mickey Harte's holders will play Derry at Pairc Esler on Saturday in a repeat of the 2016 final.
Derry saw off Monaghan 2-12 to 1-13 in the other semi-final at Armagh.
Fermanagh started the game with a flourish, driven by energy and desire, and they ran at the Tyrone defence at every opportunity, using support runners to stretch their opponents.
They went ahead through Eddie Courtney and Tomas Corrigan, and the Tyrone defence was under sustained pressure.
Midfielder Eoin Donnelly charged through with a goal on his mind, but he was denied by a superb Peter Harte block.
Tyrone finally got their opening score in the 10th minute when McCurry split the posts, and Niall McKenna brought the holders level moments later.
The Tyrone defence grew in stature as the game wore on, and restricted the Erne men to just one point in the second quarter, a third free for Corrigan.
An injury to Colm Cavanagh saw older brother Sean enter the action on the half-hour for his first appearance of 2017 and the beginning of a 16th season in the Tyrone county colours.
Harte's fourth free sent Tyrone in with a 0-7 to 0-4 interval lead, and they started moving more freely in the second period, with McCurry taking over the free-taking  duties, as well as adding a magnificent effort from play.
They went ahead by 0-10 to 0-5 and, after Paul McCusker had pulled back an Erne point, the Red Hands went 0-13 to 0-6 up, with McCurry, Cathal McShane and Lee Brennan hitting the target.
Fermanagh introduced Sean Quigley, who landed a couple of long range frees, with Aidan Breen and Corrigan also on target, but the holders held out for a place in the final.
---Sum/Tgt: Tyrone overcame a stubborn Fermanagh side 0-14 to 0-11 to reach the Dr McKenna Cup final and stay on course for a sixth successive title.

===Input Doc/Src: Chief executive Véronique Laury said the aim was to "leverage the scale of the business by becoming a single, unified company".
Details of the "ONE Kingfisher" plan came ahead of an investor day.
Investors reacted negatively to the move, sending Kingfisher shares down 6.1% to 324p in afternoon trading.
The slide made it the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 on Monday.
The retailer, which also owns Screwfix as well as Castorama in France, will face more competition following the sale of Homebase to Wesfarmers.
The Australian company plans to rebrand the DIY chain as Bunnings and revamp stores.
Ms Laury said improving Kingfisher's digital capability was one of its priorities.
Clive Black, head of research at Shore Capital, said: "It looks like Kingfisher is coming to terms with the realities of the limitations of large shops, so a focus upon the digital age. We think shareholders will welcome the focus on digital over stores and the return of cash, albeit the exceptional costs are substantial."
Independent retail analyst Nick Bubb said that the plan's goals would involve costs of up to £800m.
"The benefits aren't as clear-cut as you might think, although the news that Kingfisher also intend to return about £600m of capital to shareholders over the next three years (via share buybacks) will provide some comfort," he said.
Investec analyst Kate Calvert said the potential returns for shareholders outlined in the plan did not outweigh the risks involved.
"There are a lot of moving parts and no guarantee that all the costs will fall out and the profits come through," she said.
Kingfisher also said Rakhi Parekh, a former Amazon UK executive, had been appointed a non-executive director.
Ms Laury said Ms Parekh's extensive experience in digital and multichannel retailing would be vital to the company's plans.

New information suggests Mr Preston, then 23, may have "been murdered and buried in a specific area near junction 5 of the M53", said Supt Ian Hassall.
Officers are carrying out an "extensive land search" in the Eastham area of Wirral, Merseyside Police said.
Supt Hassall said Mr Preston was last seen by his mum, Isobel, as "he waved from his bedroom window to her when she left for work at 08:45" BST from their home in Heath Road, Bebington.
"Isobel said there had been no arguments and Steven had left home without his jacket or prescription for medication he was on", he said.
He was reported missing five days later but was never found.
"Today a painstaking search is being carried out following information recently obtained by detectives, which suggest that Steven may have been murdered and buried in a specific area of land near to junction 5 of the M53 motorway", Supt Hassall added.
Mr Preston's sister, Jane, said she was "anxious to find out what happened to her brother after all these years."
She said he was "a gentle, kind and funny lad" who "didn't have a nasty bone in him."
"He adored my mum and it destroyed her when he disappeared. She knew instantly that he wouldn't have just left and never contact her again and that something awful must have happened to him", she said.
Supt Hassall appealed for information, saying: "Sadly, Steven's mother, Isobel, and half-brother, Michael Connolly have died since his disappearance, never knowing what had happened to him.
"A young man in 20s doesn't just leave home and vanish into thin air. Somebody, somewhere must know where he is, or what happened to him."

===Input Doc/Src: The University of Southampton team looked at available medical studies and found evidence the two were linked.
But there was no proof that one necessarily caused the other.
It may be that people taking anti-depressants put on weight which, in turn, increases their diabetes risk, the team told Diabetes Care journal.
Or the drugs themselves may interfere with blood sugar control.
Their analysis of 22 studies involving thousands of patients on anti-depressants could not single out any class of drug or type of person as high risk.
Prof Richard Holt and colleagues say more research is needed to investigate what factors lie behind the findings.
And they say doctors should keep a closer check for early warning signs of diabetes in patients who have been prescribed these drugs.
With 46 million anti-depressant prescriptions a year in the UK, this potential increased risk is worrying, they say.
Prof Holt said: "Some of this may be coincidence but there's a signal that people who are being treated with anti-depressants then have an increased risk of going on to develop diabetes.
"We need to think about screening and look at means to reduce that risk."
Diabetes is easy to diagnose with a blood test, and Prof Holt says this ought to be part of a doctor's consultation.
"Diabetes is potentially preventable by changing your diet and being more physically active.
"Physical activity is also good for your mental health so there's a double reason to be thinking about lifestyle changes."
Around three million people in the UK are thought to have diabetes, with most cases being type 2.
Dr Matthew Hobbs of Diabetes UK, said: "These findings fall short of being strong evidence that taking anti-depressants directly increases risk of type 2 diabetes. In this review, even the studies that did suggest a link showed only a small effect and just because two things tend to occur together, it doesn't necessarily mean that one is causing the other.

===Input Doc/Src: The Mail calls Spider-Man: Homecoming "the blockbuster of the summer", while The Guardian calls it a "light, snappy and frequently hilarious crowdpleaser".
According to Screen Daily reviewer Tim Grierson, British actor Tom Holland - a former star of the Billy Elliot musical who turned 21 this month - "makes for a believably underage Peter Parker".
The Hollywood Reporter, though, says "a charming new lead only goes so far".
Jon Watts' film, writes critic John DeFore, is "often frustrating" and "represents a creative mis-step" for the Marvel Studios.
Largely set in New York, Spider-Man: Homecoming follows on from Holland's introduction to the "MCU" - Marvel Cinematic Universe - in Captain America: Civil War.
That 2016 film saw Spider-Man - a teenage crime-fighter who can spin webs and swing between tall buildings - participate in a battle between Captain America, Iron Man and other superheroes.
The new film sees Spider-Man's alter ego Peter Parker juggling his high school responsibilities with his secret life as a masked vigilante.
It is not long before he encounters Adrian Toomes, a villainous arms dealer who has his own alter-ego in the form of wing-sporting marauder Vulture.
Previous versions of the Spider-Man franchise featured Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield in the title role.
According to Digital Spy, "Spider-Man: Homecoming's biggest achievement is that it makes you forget it's the third different Spider-Man - and second reboot - in less than 20 years."
"There's a spontaneous charge to the film, a euphoric innocence, that makes it a much-needed antidote to stale franchise formula," raves Rolling Stone's Peter Travers.
Variety's Owen Gleiberman, meanwhile, praises the "sinister, gnashing personality" Keaton brings to his role while wishing he had been "given more to do".
"Homecoming is easily the best Spider-Man film since Sam Raimi's operatic Spider-Man 2," concludes Empire's Nick De Semlyen, one of several critics to give the movie four stars out of five.

===Input Doc/Src: The 48-year-old singer and actor Joshua Sasse, 28, announced their engagement earlier this year.
The couple subsequently vowed to postpone their nuptials until same-sex marriage becomes legal in Australia.
Dressed in "Say I Do Down Under" T-shirts at the Arias in Sydney, the pair urged the change to come next year.
"We're here to introduce a shining light in the Australian music industry," Minogue told the audience on Wednesday night.
"But we're also here to say thank you to everyone who has supported Josh's campaign for equality."
Sasse, who founded the "Say I Do Down Under" campaign, said: "This is more than a movement, this is people's lives and we want to say to every single member of the LGBT community that you are not alone.
"You have a voice and if we all stand together we can bring Australia back on the right side of history and make 2017 the year that we can all say 'I do' down under."
Australian pop star Sia also used the awards night to address the issue, sending a same-sex marriage campaigner to collect her award for best female artist.
The Australian government's plan to settle the same-sex marriage debate through a public vote early next year was blocked by the Senate two weeks ago.
Critics said a nationwide campaign would be expensive, unnecessary and unleash a torrent of homophobic rhetoric.
Sasse's "Say I Do Down Under" campaign, along with other lobby groups, is now pushing for parliament to change the law.

===Input Doc/Src: Ovidio Gonzalez was suffering from terminal throat cancer and said he had been suffering unbearable pain.
Colombia's Catholic Church has said euthanasia is morally unacceptable and it has threatened to close its hospitals across the country.
Colombia is one of the few countries in the world, and the only one in Latin America, where euthanasia is allowed.
Assisted suicide was approved by the Constitutional Court in the 1990s. But no procedures had been performed because the measure had not been regulated.
It was only in May that the health ministry intervened and issued a set of guidelines for hospitals.
Mr Gonzalez died in a clinic in the western city of Pereira, after a legal battle.
His son Julio Cesar is a cartoonist with one of Colombia's top newspapers, El Tiempo.
"My father received the news [that the procedure had been approved] with relief," said Mr Gonzalez, better known by his pen name Matador, or The Killer.
"It is a pity that it had to be like that. My dad deserved to go with less publicity," he added.
Euthanasia is highly controversial in the predominantly Roman Catholic country.
Critics also point out that the measure has not been voted by Congress.
---Sum/Tgt: A 79-year old Colombian man has become the first person in the country to die legally by euthanasia.

===Input Doc/Src: During the election campaign, David Cameron talked about how the government needs to save £1 from every £100 it spends - so 3% should put it well ahead of where it needs to be.
Unfortunately, it's not that simple. Today's announcement highlights why that 1% cuts figure was not entirely helpful.
The first problem is that things get more expensive, even at a time when the official measure of inflation is negative.
The National Health Service gets more expensive every year because the population is growing and ageing and because as medical science advances there are more things that can be treated.
Indeed, the government has promised an extra £8bn above inflation to the NHS by 2020, which will presumably have to be made up through further cuts in other departments.
Education spending is protected for children aged five to 16 in terms of cash per pupil, so rising pupil numbers would also need to be made up for by cuts elsewhere.
And international aid is protected and will rise in line with the amount the economy grows.
There are other areas of spending that the government will struggle to cut. Although the amount it is borrowing each year is falling, the total amount it has borrowed is still increasing, which means interest must be paid on more money, albeit at a very low interest rate.
The cost of public sector pensions keeps growing as more civil servants retire and live longer.
And the state pension is triply protected, rising by inflation, wages or 2.5%, whichever is the higher.
To deal with all this, the government is planning to cut £12bn from the welfare bill and save £5bn by cutting back on tax avoidance, but most of the rest comes from cutting spending in unprotected departments. And 3% cuts would not be enough.
The Institute for Fiscal Studies reckons that the current plans to cut spending by 1% for the next two years and then freeze it for a third will actually mean cuts for unprotected departments averaging 5.4% a year for three years.
Which is not to say th
---Sum/Tgt: The chancellor announced today that Whitehall departments have found £3bn of savings this financial year, which is equivalent to around 3% of unprotected departmental spending this year.

===Input Doc/Src: Stephen Ngila has been arrested for allegedly attacking Jackline Mwende almost two weeks ago, reports say.
Kenya has high levels of domestic abuse but Mrs Mwende's case was "particularly shocking", activists added.
Mr Ngila has not yet commented.
Mrs Mwende, 27, said a drunk Mr Ngila, 34, told her "today is your last day" before he attacked her at her parents' home in a village in southern Machakos County, Kenya's Daily Nation newspaper reports.
This was despite the fact that doctors told them she was fertile and he was impotent, Mrs Mwende was quoted as saying.
A video of her with stitches on her head and stumps where her hands once were, wrapped in bandages, has also been shown by Kenyan media.
The couple were living separately when Mr Ngila allegedly attacked Mrs Mwende, reports said.
Reuters news agency quotes Kenyan women's rights group Equality Now as saying that Mr Ngila has been charged with attempted murder, but there has been no independent confirmation of this.
"This is a particularly shocking case for Kenya... even though domestic violence is rampant," Naitore Nyamu of Equality Now told Reuters.
"We can't afford to let the perpetrators act with impunity - which has sometimes been the case in recent years," she added.
The chairwoman of Kenya's Federation of Women Lawyers (FIDA), Josephine Mong'are, said cases of violence against women had been "escalating" and police should ensure that "all culprits are brought to book".
"FIDA Kenya reiterates that violence against women is unacceptable and must not be condoned in society," she said.

But now France also has 1/11, another set of numbers etched in the annals of the terrible history of terrorism and stirring stories of people who fight back.
Nearly four million took to the streets and squares across France on Sunday 11 January for a Unity march in the wake of three days of terror that left 17 dead, and a nation saddened, stunned, and - it is hoped - strengthened in a new solidarity.
Never have so many French citizens turned out in such large numbers since the liberation of Paris from Nazi Germany in 1944.
"I'm proud of my country," reflects French journalist Nicolas Henin. "People often join protests for more jobs or higher salaries, but this wasn't for something immediate. It was for France's future."
More than a decade ago, in the wake of the shocking attacks in New York and Washington on 11 September, the slogan that sounded from many capitals was: "We're standing shoulder to shoulder."
Now there is a new version of the same refrain in the most pronounced show of solidarity since then: "Le monde se leve" (The world rises) was the Sunday morning headline in Le Journal du Dimanche.
The morning after, one word was splashed across many front pages in France - "Debout" (Standing). "The world stands with France" was the top line of the International New York Times.
Nearly 50 world leaders cleared their diaries to literally stand shoulder to shoulder again.
They marched, arms linked, along part of the route to be, and be seen to be, part of a French story of pain and resolve.
Now, more than ever, this battle is recognised as a global fight against rising extremism. But some leaders had other reasons too.

===Input Doc/Src: The book was returned after American owner Marshall Whitehead decided to track down the family of the original owner.
It was eventually handed to Donald Mackechnie, 66, at his home in Glasgow.
The Bible had originally belonged to the great-grandfather of Mr Mackechnie's grandmother.
Mr Whitehead, who was gifted the pocket-sized book in 2001 by an amateur Bible collector from Cleveland, Ohio, had rediscovered it when moving home in May.
Noting that the Bible bore the name Alexander MacDonald of Inverness with the date 1 January, 1866, he decided to track down the descendants of Mr MacDonald, who was born in 1825 and worked as a ship master, wine merchant and grocer.
After contacting Highland Council, he was put in touch with Anne Fraser, a historian at the Highland Archive Centre who created a MacDonald family tree.
Mr Whitehead then used social media to track down Mr Mackechnie's daughter Mairi in Glasgow, who alerted her Islay-raised father.
The Bible, which had a four-leaf clover tucked within its pages, was hand-delivered to Mr Mackechnie by Alistair Begg, a pastor at Mr Whitehead's church in Ohio who is originally from Glasgow and was visiting relatives in the city last month.
Mr Mackechnie, clerk to the board at St Columba Gaelic Church of Scotland in Glasgow, said: "There was a knock on the door one day and this chap was standing there.
"I almost fell on the floor when he explained what he was giving me. I could not believe it, it was such a shock and a surprise.
"The whole family are delighted and over the moon to receive his previously unheard of family heirloom.
"It does not even enter your head that this kind of thing could ever happen - it is quite amazing."
Mr Mackechnie, a retired mechanical design draftsman, said the story of the Bible's return to Scotland is "fascinating and shows there are still kind people in the world".

===Input Doc/Src: Four years ago, Veronica Boquete's winner denied Anna Signeul's side a place at the Euro 2013 finals.
But the disappointment this time round was every bit as real as Virginia Torrecilla cancelled out Emma Mitchell's opener in the dying seconds.
It kept intact Spain's unbeaten record under new head coach Jorge Vilda.
Despite the visitors enjoying the bulk of possession early on, it was Scotland who created the first real chance, Leanne Ross combining with Jane Ross before firing in a low cross that goalkeeper Dolores Gallardo managed to smother at the feet of the on-rushing Kim Little.
The visitors' best chance fell to Amanda Sampedro, but her header looped harmlessly over goalkeeper Gemma Fay's crossbar.
Jane Ross was a constant threat for Scotland, causing problems with her pace and movement, but neither team were able to create much in the way of a goalscoring opportunity.
It was no surprise then that the opening goal came from a strike from distance, Mitchell going on a powerful run from her left-back position before unleashing an unstoppable effort that Gallardo could only parry into her own net.
The goal sparked Spain into life and Alexia Putellas should have found an equaliser after a passage of intricate build-up play found her in space in the box, but the strike was well over.
Jane Ross came agonisingly close to ensuring the win late on as she connected with Mitchell's cross from the left, but Gallardo was able to get her body in the way and deny what would have been a very deserved goal for the Scotland striker.
Then came the sucker punch. With the clock ticking over to 90 minutes, Spain won a corner and Torrecilla found the touch to finally beat Fay in the Scotland goal.
Scotland, presently ranked 21st in the world, will take positives from a match where they went toe-to-toe with a top-15 ranked nation - Spain are at their highest-ever position of 14th.
Signeul's side now build towards next month's crucial Euro17 qualifier against Slovenia in Paisley.

===Input Doc/Src: Uncertainty over Black Friday trading, investment in online ordering, and a "challenging" first half could mean underlying full-year profit before tax is below £115m, Home Retail Group said.
In the half year to 29 August, group sales fell 2% to £2.6bn.
But underlying profit before tax increased by 10% to £34.1m.
Home Retail Group chief executive John Walden said: "While group benchmark profit before tax increased slightly during the first half, performance overall was mixed."
And he added: "At this stage of the financial year we expect the group's full-year benchmark profit before tax to be slightly below the bottom end of the current range of market expectations of £115m to £140m."
Home Retail Group shares dived almost 14% in early trading in reaction to the warning.
Mr Walden reiterated that trading at Argos over the key Christmas period was likely to be "less predictable than usual" due to the impact of Black Friday shopping deals.
Originating in the US, Black Friday is becoming a major day for UK retailers. Last year, police were called in a number of UK cities amid frenzied buying from shoppers.
Analysts said Black Friday offers caused a shift in spending patterns in the final quarter of last year, which may have had a negative impact on Christmas shopping.
Mr Walden said Home Retail Group had increased investment in "Fast Track", Argos' online ordering, delivery, and click-and-collect service.
The service, which was announced last week, offers a same-day delivery service across the UK, seven days a week.
Home Retail Group is in the process of trying to transform Argos from a catalogue-based retailer into a more digital business.
However, Mr Walden said that Argos had a "challenging first half", with like-for-like sales down 3.4%. The chain suffered from weak sales of TVs and tablet computers.
But Homebase like-for-like sales rose 5.6%, with Hygena kitchens, Ideal Standards bathrooms and Habitat furniture sales growing.
---Sum/Tgt: The owner of Argos and Homebase, Home Retail Group, has warned that its full-year underlying profits are set to fall below market expectations.

The country's premier also urged telecoms companies to cut fees, including data roaming charges.
It was not revealed how much money would be invested.
Besides the government investment, Premier Li Keqiang also urged telecoms companies to cut their prices and up their speeds, according to China's cabinet the State Council.
He also said they should cut data roaming charges for Chinese tourists, although he acknowledged that it was ultimately for the market to decide.
He did, however, announce a round of investment infrastructure improvements to the same end.
"China has more cell-phone users than any other country, but its internet service speed ranks below 80th in the world due to underdeveloped information infrastructure," the premier said, according to a release from the State Council.
He added that "speeding up the construction of information infrastructure will boost investment and support" in China, as well as helping "mass innovation".
Telecoms firms should make rapid moves to cut prices and increase urban broadband speeds by around 40%, according to Mr Li.
China's investment in broadband could benefit global network equipment makers such as Ericsson and Nokia Oyj's Alcatel-Lucent, as well as home-grown players like Huawei Technologies and ZTE.
Mr Li did not say how much investment would be needed, but officials have previously earmarked around 2tn yuan ($322bn, Â£204bn) to improve China's broadband infrastructure by 2020.

===Input Doc/Src: Supt David Borrie, of Northumbria Police, is said to have simply been told "don't apply for promotion" by his chief constable, Mike Craik.
Mr Craik has been at the centre of allegations about officers' conduct.
The claim was made at a tribunal brought by the force's former head of legal services.
Denise Aubrey, 54, was sacked in 2014 for gross misconduct after allegedly disclosing information about an affair Mr Craik was said to be having with his assistant chief constable, Carolyn Peacock, and a second relationship between two further high-ranking officers.
Mr Aubrey denies she did so and is claiming unfair dismissal, sexual and disability discrimination, victimisation and harassment.
In her witness statement, she said Mr Borrie, who is now 57 and retired from the force, pursued the "extremely vulnerable" civilian member of staff, who cannot be named for legal reasons, and "groped her in the office".
She said: "On another occasion, he took her for a drink in the afternoon at a pub and then pressurised her into giving him oral sex."
This happened a second time and eventually an investigation was launched, the tribunal in North Shields heard.
Ms Aubrey said: "Whilst it was felt that a criminal charge would not succeed, he had clearly breached police standards.
"Instead, it was decided to move him but to allow him to complete his service so that he could get his pension. Mr Craik decided to have a 'quiet word' with him and told him 'not to bother applying for promotion'.
"However, the IPCC [the police watchdog] insisted that he received a formal written warning."
Earlier in the week, the tribunal was told Mrs Peacock's husband, who was also a policeman, punched Mr Craik at a barbecue after learning of the affair.
Officers were called to deal with the altercation, but the record of the incident was then said to be deleted - leading to an allegation of a "cover-up" by Ms Aubrey's QC, Daphne Romney.
Rumours of the relationship began circulating in 2007, Ms Aubrey said.

The editorial board was unimpressed with the debate, saying "when just one candidate is serious and the other is a vacuous bully, the term loses all meaning".
Opinion writer Nick Kristof said Trump had "hurt himself", others said Mrs Clinton had "crushed" her opponent.
But Ross Douthat said Mrs Clinton did not "goad Trump into a true meltdown or knock him out with a truly devastating attack". She "won the night, but he lived to fight another day", he said.

===Input Doc/Src: The Police Reform and Social Responsibility Bill creates police commissioners and changes the balance of power with chief constables.
At the heart of the government's proposals is a complete overhaul of the local control of police forces.
There are 43 forces for England and Wales and the government says it won't be merging them.
Instead, it says it wants to strengthen local democratic control by creating Police and Crime Commissioners for each force.
The commissioner will be directly elected and will hold the chief constable to account - meaning they will be able to hire and fire chief constables.
According to the legislation, the commissioner's basic duties will be to publish a "police and crime plan", set local police and crime objectives and the budget. The commissioner will also set the amount of the "precept" that their local electors have to pay, the part of police funding collected through the council tax.
The chief constable will appoint all other officers and will "retain responsibility for the direction and control of the police force".
The police commissioner takes over the responsibilities of the current police authorities - but they will have the additional power of being able to sack a chief constable. Under the current system, chiefs are appointed by the force's police authority in consultation with the Home Office.
Each force in England and Wales outside of London will elect a police commissioner in May 2012. The commissioners will be able to hold office for two terms.
London is being treated differently because the Metropolitan Police Commissioner is Britain's top police officer with national duties including co-ordinating counter-terrorism.

Here is what stands out for me from today's announcement.
1) The Scottish parliament will have total control over income tax rates and the thresholds at which they kick in (but Westminster will still set the tax-free allowance).
2) Revenue raised from the first 10 percentage points of VAT on Scottish spending will be allotted to the Scottish government.
3) The Scottish parliament will have power both to create new benefits and vary some planned and existing benefits - including the housing cost element of Universal Credit, benefits for carers and the disabled, and cold weather related payments.
There are lots of other important new powers being transferred to Holyrood, including the ability to lower the voting age, change speed limits, license frackers, influence the new BBC Charter, and - possibly - change abortion rules.
But it is the transfer of big tax and spending powers that creates significant fiscal and economic uncertainties - whose resolution may have serious political consequences.
The lynchpin of all this is what the Commission calls the fiscal framework for the new devolution, which includes a number of principles.
Perhaps the most important is that at the precise moment that the new powers are devolved, Scotland's budget and the UK's budget should neither be bigger or smaller as a result of this transfer to Holyrood of new spending and taxing powers.
Or to put it another way, the block grant paid to Scotland under the Barnett formula should be reduced to account for taxes devolved to Scotland and increased to account for spending transferred to Scotland - and future payments under the new Barnett formula should be indexed to protect their real value.
Or to put it another way, neither Scots taxpayers or those in the rest of the UK should suffer detriment as a direct result of the new devolution.

===Input Doc/Src: Philip Garvey, 56, his wife Ann, 55, and their children Emily, 23, and Daniel, 20, died when their plane came down in Somerset in November 2015.
They were flying from Surrey to Devon.
The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) said it was possible Mr Garvey tried to manually start landing while the autopilot was still on.
Mr Garvey had taken off from Fairoakes Airport, close to the family home in Woking, and was heading to Dunkeswell Aerodrome.
The AAIB's report said it was an overcast and rainy day and all planned flights at Dunkeswell had been cancelled because of the weather.
Several witnesses told investigators they heard a sound like a plane doing "aerobatics" before the Piper Malibu Mirage appeared from the clouds and hit the ground near Churchinford, south of Taunton.
The AAIB said: "The evidence from the autopilot examination system suggested that, as the pilot turned on to the final approach and started to descend, the autopilot may not have been disengaged due to a mental lapse, incorrect button selection or a technical fault."
The plane was seen to quickly climb into cloud before coming down.
The AAIB concluded it was "unable to determine with certainty the reason for the initial rapid climb" but said attempting to override the autopilot would have caused the plane to go "nose up" as it would fight to maintain its set height.
While the aircraft could still have been controllable, it said "recovery may have been beyond his capabilities".
Mr Garvey had been a pilot since 2012 and had flown to Dunkeswell 25 times since 2013, including 14 times from Fairoaks.
His instructors told investigators he was "less able than average pilots at multi-tasking and poor at prioritising especially when under pressure".
Another instructor said Mr Garvey "would often have difficulty dealing with an unusual or unexpected condition".

"You shot Lucy Lee in the back of her head after she made the 999 call, then reloaded your gun and pursued her outside the cottage, with the intention of making sure that this time she died," he said.
In a victim impact statement Stacy Banner, Lucy Lee's sister, said she was "haunted by what Lowe has done".
She said Lucy was the "big sister who comforted and preceded me" and the murders had left her struggling to eat and sleep.
Outside court, she said: "I'm relieved it's over. He's never getting out."
Ms Banner has criticised police for returning guns to Lowe just months before he carried out the shootings.
Surrey Police has admitted the decision "was flawed and did not meet national standards".
Three Surrey Police employees are being investigated for gross misconduct by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) over the decision to return the weapons.
Christine Lee's sister, Julia James, said she felt "despair, physically and emotionally" since the death of her two relatives.
"I miss them more than I can say," she said.
At the start of the hearing, prosecutor Mark Dennis QC said Lowe's advanced age should not "dramatically" reduce his sentence and the "starting point" for a double murder of this kind would be a minimum of 30 years in jail.
Surrey's Police and Crime Commissioner Kevin Hurley said as the trial was now over the inquiry could focus on why Lowe was given back his guns
---Sum/Tgt: An 82-year-old man has been jailed for life for murdering his partner and her daughter who he shot at close range at his puppy farm in Surrey.

===Input Doc/Src: In addition to the ban for single women, married women can only freeze their eggs in specific circumstances - for instance when they are to undergo chemotherapy, state media say.
The ban is not new but caught attention after news that actress Xu Jinglei had gone to the US to have her eggs frozen.
Many have ridiculed the ban and described it as sexist.
The debate began in July, after Xu Jinglei, 41, said that she had frozen her ova, or egg cells, in the US in 2013.
The 41-year-old, who is considered one of China's "Big Four" actresses, said she had taken the decision because she might want children in the future.
Then on Sunday, state-run broadcaster CCTV ran a report on the subject, which highlighted some of the risks associated with the procedure and said the ban was "in accordance with family planning policies".
The report triggered a barrage of criticism on Chinese social media, with close to 33,000 comments on CCTV's weibo (microblog) thread alone, and more than 11 million views for hashtags related to the subject.
"We don't even have control over own own ovaries anymore!" user "Kitty is a Lace Lover" wrote.
"Its meaning is that unmarried women don't have the right to reproduce," user Fish girl wrote.
Many questioned why China allowed male sperm donors, but prevented women from freezing their eggs, while others mocked the ban as an attempt to force more women to marry and have children in a hurry.
"This ban should help the men that no one wants!" one user wrote.
There are fewer limitations on the storage of sperm in China.
State media say the restrictions are designed to combat a black market in human eggs, and have stressed the possible health risks associated with the procedure.
China introduced its one-child policy at the end of the 1970s to curb rapid population growth - but eased the policy in 2013 amid concerns over the country's ageing population.
---Sum/Tgt: There has been intense debate in China over a controversial ban on single women freezing their eggs.

===Input Doc/Src: A senior official at the Tunisian interior ministry told the Associated Press that Rezgui had been in Libya in January, the same time as two men who attacked a Tunisian museum in March.
Most of the dead in Sousse were foreign tourists, including 30 Britons.
The Islamic State group (IS) has claimed the attack as its own.
"The attacker trained in Libya with weapons at the same period as the Bardo [museum] attackers," Rafik Chelli from the interior ministry told AP.
IS also said it was behind the Bardo museum attack in Tunis that left 22 people dead.
Mr Chelli said that Rezgui had travelled to the Libyan town of Sabratha at the same time as the Bardo attackers.
"He crossed the borders secretly," Mr Chielli told AP.
IS has a significant presence in Libya, Tunisia's eastern neighbour, and is thought to control the major towns of Derna and Sirte.
The Tunisian authorities have released photos of two suspects, Bin Abdallah and Rafkhe Talari - friends of Rezgui that the police have yet to locate.
Rezgui, 23, was radicalised while studying engineering.
The Tunisian authorities have already arrested several suspected accomplices.
However, Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi has admitted that the security services were not prepared for an attack of this kind.
He said extra security had been put in place at other locations during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, but nobody had expected beaches to be a target.
The UK Foreign Office has updated its travel advice to warn that further terrorist attacks in Tunisia are possible, and has urged people to be vigilant.
Tour companies have laid on extra flights and about 10,000 British tourists have flown home from Tunisia since Friday, according to the Association of British Travel Agents.
The repatriation of bodies of Britons killed in the attack will begin on Wednesday, Downing Street has said.
Twenty-one Britons have been identified as victims, with nine more believed to be among the dead, it added.
Three Irish tourists, two Germans

===Input Doc/Src: Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson said it was a great deal for taxpayers, with the club paying about Â£4.4m per year in return for the council's support.
But the city's Liberal Democrat leader Richard Kemp asked why a club largely owned by "billionaire" businessman Farhad Moshiri needed council backing.
He asked: "What are the safeguards?"
The council cabinet has agreed to set up a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to help Everton secure the investment it needs to build a new 50,000 capacity ground at Bramley-Moore Dock on the banks of the Mersey.
Everton last week announced a deal to acquire the land needed for the project.
The local authority said its agreement with Everton includes measures to ensure it will always be paid by the football club.
"It is not just a good deal for the council in terms of receiving funding but equally it is going to be the driver for regeneration for north Liverpool," said Mr Anderson.
"From my point of view, it is job done."
Mr Kemp said he still has his doubts.
"I am not against the deal itself but I want to know what the safeguards are. I want to know the direct benefit for the council.
"Why do billionaires need a guarantee from a third party? In fact why do they need a loan at all?"
Mr Anderson said he had had several meetings with Iranian businessman Mr Moshiri, who bought a 49.9% share in the Premier League club last year.
"We're not funding a billionaire - we are actually doing a great deal for Liverpool City Council," said Mr Anderson.
"I am not here to browbeat Everton into starting but... I certainly want them to crack on because if we get chosen for the Commonwealth Games in 2022 we will need to deliver."
Prof Tom Cannon, emeritus professor at the University of Liverpool's School of Management, said the stadium would bring direct benefits to the city and the council.
"The economic benefit is development of another strong economic agent in a growth area like sport and it reinforces the city's burgeoning strength as a leading centre fo

===Input Doc/Src: Scrum-half Takulua kicked two penalties to put Newcastle 6-0 up at half-time against a wasteful Worcester side.
A third penalty edged Falcons further ahead before Will Welch was sin-binned as Worcester grabbed a penalty try.
Wynand Olivier's score edged Worcester ahead, but Tongan scrum-half Takulua converted his own try to seal victory.
The win does enough to mathematically keep Falcons in contention for a place in European club rugby's top competition for the first time in 12 years, as the team finishing seventh in the table earn the chance to qualify through the play-offs.
However, a win for Northampton at Exeter on Saturday ends all hopes, which also come with other permutations outside their final league standing.
Falcons' aspirations were under real threat throughout at Kingston Park, with Worcester seeing a number of good chances go begging before the break, the best of which saw Perry Humphreys knock-on close to the line.
A penalty try from a maul, which also saw Newcastle's Welch yellow-carded, was their first response after going 9-0 down.
Olivier's try edged the visitors ahead for the first time, with both sides momentarily a man down soon after as Will Spencer was sin-binned for the hosts.
And as Worcester closed in for their first away league win for 13 months, Takulua dived over and kept his cool when adding the extra two points to cap a fine individual display.
Newcastle: Watson; Goneva, C Harris, Socino, Sinoti; Hodgson, Takulua; Vickers, Lawson, Welsh, Green, Robinson, M Wilson, Welch (capt), Chick.

===Input Doc/Src: Vikki Thompson was being held at Armley where she was found dead on Friday. She told her friends she would kill herself if she was sent to a male prison.
The incident prompted the prisons minister to respond to an urgent question in the House of Commons.
Andrew Selous told a debate they are "reviewing prison service instruction".
Updates on this story and more from around West Yorkshire
Tim Farron, Lib Dem leader, tweeted: "We must reform the law urgently."
Cat Smith, shadow minister for women and equalities, asked if the policy guidelines for transgender prisoners were adequate, and if they are being properly applied.
Mr Selous responded: "Her death like all others in custody is a tragedy and we are totally committed to reducing the number of deaths in prisons.
"We believe that Vikki Thompson was being looked after in accordance with the relevant procedures, but that is now a matter for the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman and Coroner."
He said a review of the policy relating to the care of transgender prisoners had begun earlier this year, and revised policy guidance will be issued and implemented "in due course".
It is estimated there are around 80 transgender prisoners in the UK, although the Ministry of Justice does not keep precise figures.
The debate also follows a transgender woman being sent to a men's prison in Bristol.
80
is the current estimate of transgender people in UK prisons
85,977 prisoners are men, according to the latest figures
3,935 prisoners are female
Tara Hudson, from Bath, was later transferred to a female prison after a campaign to get her moved.
Ms Smith said: "I first raised the issue of Tara Hudson, a young trans woman who was placed in a men's prison on the floor of this house on the 3rd of November.
"It's a tragedy that within three weeks of that, we are once again discussing the issue of trans prisoners."
Jackie Brooklyn, Ms Hudson's mother, said her daughter was "absolutely heartbroken and disgusted" when she heard about Vikki Thomps

===Input Doc/Src: Ivor Miller, 27, who has learning difficulties, was chased by the group after one member called him "a beast".
The 27-year-old sought refuge in a derelict flat and jumped out a second floor window suffering severe injury.
At the High Court in Glasgow, judge Norman Ritchie QC ordered a 17-year-old man to be detained for six months.
The judge told the eight accused: "This whole incident, some of which was captured on CCTV, is extremely disturbing.
"The group, like a pack of animals, turned on an entirely innocent young man for no good reason other than he behaved differently because he has learning difficulties."
Three of those who pursued Mr Miller were originally charged with attempted murder.
Michael Clare, 21, from Airdrie, North Lanarkshire, and two 17-year-old youths, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had their guilty pleas to charges of assault accepted.
All three admitted attacking Mr Miller by chasing him into the common close at 52 Howard Street, Glasgow, on 4 August last year.
All three, and another 17-year-old youth, a 16-year-old girl, a 16-year-old youth and 23-year-old David Newlands, from Maryhill, Glasgow, admitted committing a breach of the peace and placing Mr Miller in a state of fear and alarm.
Newlands also pleaded guilty to punching Mr Miller on the head in the Hootenanny pub in Howard Street.
Jade Park, 19, from Glasgow, who sparked the incident by falsely calling Mr Miller "a beast" admitted punching him in Jamaica Street and in the Crystal Palace pub.
Judge Ritchie sentenced a 17-year-old male to six months detention for assault.
He deferred sentence on Park, who is about to give birth, until June for good behaviour and imposed a community payback order on all the others and ordered then to perform 150 hours unpaid work in the community.

===Input Doc/Src: The strikes by RMT, Aslef and Unite union members will start on the evenings of 26 January, 15 February and 17 February.
RMT General Secretary Mick Cash said the plans to introduce a Night Tube were "bodged".
London Underground called the unions' position "absurd".
It has offered a four-year pay deal over the issue and said it would hire part-time drivers to staff an all-night service at weekends.
More on this and other London stories.
Aslef claimed earlier London Underground management had refused to meet to discuss conditions for working on the proposed Night Tube.
The union's London district organiser, Finn Brennan, said: "We genuinely regret the inconvenience that will be caused but the behaviour of London Underground's senior management team have left us with no other choice.
Steve Griffiths, LU's chief operating officer, responded: "The unions' position is absurd and detached from the real world."
He added: "The truth is that they expect our customers to pay for their excessive demands for even more money, fewer hours and a four-day week."
"No employer could allow this and strike action will change nothing. There is no more money."
The Night Tube, which was due to begin in September, will see 24-hour services on five lines on Fridays and Saturdays.
Tube drivers are also unhappy with pay and station rosters, according to BBC London transport correspondent Tom Edwards.
RMT general secretary Mick Cash said the union supported the principle of a "properly worked-out night Tube service" but said an "abject failure to work through the detail has led to a comprehensive breakdown in the negotiations".
London Mayor Boris Johnson said: "If a strike goes ahead, it will hit many London Underground workers who do not necessarily support the action, and it will cost the strikers in lost pay."
But Labour mayoral candidate Sadiq Khan said Mr Johnson was to blame, arguing: "It proves once and for all that the Tory strategy of refusing to negotiate or even meet with the unions

===Input Doc/Src: Glenn Murray put the Eagles ahead when he headed in from close range after Bolasie's deflected cross.
Bolasie added a second soon afterwards as he poked the ball past Costel Pantilimon after Murray's knockdown.
A lofted finish from Bolasie made it 3-0 and he completed his treble from Murray's pass before Connor Wickham volleyed in a late consolation.
The result, the second time in three home games that Sunderland have conceded four goals, increases the Black Cats' relegation fears.
Media playback is not supported on this device
They have been in the Premier League for eight successive seasons but are now 16th in the table, only three points above QPR and Burnley.
Sunderland have only six games left to save themselves, but their last two matches of the season are away at Arsenal and then at current leaders Chelsea.
Dick Advocaat, brought in after former manager Gus Poyet had been sacked following a 4-0 home defeat by Aston Villa, had stressed the importance of this match to his side.
But he was let down by some woeful defending as the hosts capitulated and conceded four goals in a 14-minute spell early in the second half.
After a quiet first half that was low on quality and goalscoring chances, but high on fierce challenges, the match sprung into life within three minutes of the restart.
Murray headed in his sixth goal in six games to set Palace on their way to their eighth win in 12 Premier League games since Alan Pardew took over at the start of the January.
But even he could not have expected what was to follow.
The hosts fell apart and three minutes later Bolasie, with one goal in his previous 27 league matches this season, got to Murray's flick-on first to make it 2-0.

Norfolk Fire and Rescue Service incident commander Simon Mason said crews may remain at the scene for a second night.
A National Trust spokeswoman thanked firefighters who "worked tirelessly".
Residents from two houses have gone to stay with family and friends, while the third family has been re-homed in a holiday cottage, the National Trust said.
"We do not know the cause or full extent of the fire yet but, most importantly, there have been no reports of any injuries and all of the tenants were able to get out of the cottages," said the trust's spokeswoman.
"We are enormously grateful to the crews who reached the cottages quickly, worked tirelessly to tackle the fire and have maintained a constant presence."
About 70 firefighters attended the blaze as it ripped through the roofs of the cottages.
"We expect to be on the scene for the remainder for the day and maybe over the night," said Mr Mason.

"She is resting tonight but wants to chat tomorrow [Saturday] via Facebook Live so she can let everyone know how she's doing and answer some questions."
Mattek-Sands was treated by paramedics on the court before being carried off on a stretcher and taken straight to hospital.
The 32-year-old later wrote on social media: "To the best family, friends and fans a girl could ask for, it's been a painful and emotional 36 hours but thank you for all the love and support."
Mattek-Sands had been favourite to add a Wimbledon doubles title to her US Open, Australian Open and French Open victories with Czech partner Lucie Safarova, who went to the court when she heard about the injury.
Mattek-Sands has also received support from the tennis world. Nine-time Wimbledon singles champion Martina Navratilova wrote on social media: "Am just devastated about Bethanie Mattek-Sands and her injury - we are all behind you, hoping for the best - lots of love, m."

===Input Doc/Src: Researchers assessing the results of nearly 200 studies say sperm counts among men from North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, seem to have halved in less than 40 years.
Some experts are sceptical of the Human Reproduction Update findings.
But lead researcher Dr Hagai Levine said he was "very worried" about what might happen in the future.
The assessment, one of the largest ever undertaken, brings together the results of 185 studies between 1973 and 2011.
Dr Levine, an epidemiologist, told the BBC that if the trend continued humans would become extinct.
"If we will not change the ways that we are living and the environment and the chemicals that we are exposed to, I am very worried about what will happen in the future," he said.
"Eventually we may have a problem, and with reproduction in general, and it may be the extinction of the human species."
Scientists not involved in the study have praised the quality of the research but say that it may be premature to come to such a conclusion.
Dr Levine, from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, found a 52.4% decline in sperm concentration, and a 59.3% decline in total sperm count in men from North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand.
The study also indicates the rate of decline among men living in these countries is continuing and possibly even increasing.
In contrast, no significant decline was seen in South America, Asia and Africa, but the researchers point out that far fewer studies have been conducted on these continents. However, Dr Levine is concerned that eventually sperm counts could fall in these places too.
Many previous studies have indicated similar sharp declines in sperm count in developed economies, but sceptics say that a large proportion of them have been flawed.
Some have investigated a relatively small number of men, or included only men who attend fertility clinics and are, in any case, more likely to have low sperm counts.
There is also concern that studies that claim to show a decli

Cesar Vilca had been missing for 20 days, after his unit came under attack by rebels in the southern Cusco region.
Another officer, Luis Astuquillca, was shot in the leg but walked for 17 days through the rainforest to safety.
With the help of two local people who had spotted Cesar's body, Mr Vilca set off to recover his remains.
Travelling in a pick-up truck, the group reached the spot and took the police officer's corpse back to the nearest community.
Mr Vilca had complained that the authorities had wound down their efforts to locate Cesar.
But the interior ministry noted that there had been "an intense and prolonged search"  that had cost the lives of three members of the security forces.
Cesar Vilca and his unit were deployed on 12 April to search for a group of 36 gas workers abducted by Shining Path rebels.
They came under fire from the guerrillas and four officers were killed.
The hostages were released by their captors six days after being abducted in a remote region close to the Ene-Apurimac valley - one of the last strongholds of the Shining Path.

===Input Doc/Src: They believe a Canadian lynx was prowling around the fields of the South West in 1903 before being shot after attacking two dogs in Devon.
Tests on the animal revealed it had probably spent some time in captivity before escaping or being set free.
The animal had been donated to Bristol Museum at the time of its death and kept in its stores for decades.
The scientists' findings are published in the journal Historical Biology.
Dr Ross Barnett, a molecular biologist from the University of Copenhagen and the University of Durham, said:  "I've seen one of these cats in the wild.
"They are pretty impressive cats - they are a reasonable size, and they have lots of fluffy fur which makes them look even bigger. They have sharp claws, teeth and strong muscles."
From blurry photos of the Beast of Bodmin Moor in Cornwall, to reports of a lion on the loose in Essex in 2012, the UK has a long tradition of spotting big cats.
Most of these claims are dismissed as misidentifications, hoaxes or even hallucinations, but not in this case.
In 1903, the unusual cat was donated to the Bristol Museum and Art Gallery. The museum's records state that it had been shot after attacking and killing two dogs close to Newton Abbot in Devon.
Unsure of exactly what it was, the exotic beast was stuffed, its skeleton preserved, and then the remains were tucked away in the museum's stores.
More than a century later, the cat was unearthed by a scientist who thought the find might be significant.
An analysis of the skeleton and mounted skin revealed that the animal was a Canadian lynx, which is about two to three times the size of a domestic cat and is usually found in Canada and the northern states of the US.
The researchers found that the animal's teeth were badly decayed.
Dr Barnett said:  "We think it had probably been in captivity at some point in its life.
"It had lost all of its incisors, which would have been a pretty debilitating injury for a wild cat, but not a problem for one in captivity.

===Input Doc/Src: Lucas Bigley, 19, stabbed Matthew Wilson to death in Sheffield on 28 May in a "violent and brutal attack".
Hull Crown Court heard the two men had fallen out after Mr Wilson, also 19, began a relationship with Bigley's mother.
Bigley, of Wadsley Lane, Sheffield, was told he must serve at least 22 years in jail.

Hull Crown Court heard Bigley was still wearing his heavily blood-soaked clothing and attempting to wash the blood from his hands when was arrested in the early hours of 28 May.
Det Ch Insp Craig Jackson said: "This was a violent and brutal attack on Matthew, a young man whom Bigley once considered his friend.
"The court heard how both he and the victim knew each other for many years, but their friendship broke down after Matthew began a romantic relationship with Bigley's mother.
"His anger and frustration came to the fore in the early hours of that morning in May and a young man who had everything to live for has now tragically lost his life."
Mr Wilson's family said in a statement they were "satisfied" with the jury's verdict.
However, they added: "While we regard the sentence Bigley has been given as fair, no sentence will ever bring Matt back to us.
"We too have been handed a life sentence."

===Input Doc/Src: Mohanna Abdhou, 20, was shot in Malvern Road, Kilburn, and died at the scene.
Ms Abdhou, known as Montana, was approached by "two males" on bicycles who fired "shots at her group of friends".
Police said nothing in her background gave "any suggestion she would have been a target" in the shooting, which took place on Friday, 26 May.
CCTV images of the men believed to have carried out the shooting have also been released.
Footage shows the two suspects at 20.53 BST cycling along Malvern Place, seconds before turning into Malvern Road where the shooting took place, police said.
They are described as being of slim to medium build, both wearing dark clothing and concealing their appearance through the use of face coverings.
A 21-year-old man who was arrested at the scene on the night of the attack has been released under investigation pending further enquiries.
A 19-year-old man and a man, aged 20, were arrested in west London on suspicion of murder in the early hours of 31 May. They have been bailed pending further enquiries.
Ch Insp Andy Partridge said: "Valuable information has been passed to us but we are certain that people in the local community know who has committed this horrific attack.
"These individuals should not be shielded by friends or family, or supported in any way.
"No right-minded person would want those responsible for depriving Mohanna's family from ever seeing her again, to evade capture.
"Mohanna's family deserve answers and that will only happen if the local community tells us who carried out this attack."

===Input Doc/Src: Oscar Munoz said he felt "shame and embarrassment" and vowed it would never happen again to a seated passenger on one of United's aircraft.
The embattled aviation boss said the passenger in question, David Dao, deserved "certainly an apology".
Mr Munoz initially described Mr Dao as "disruptive and belligerent".
United Airline's public relations disaster
Why do airlines overbook?
"That shame and embarrassment was pretty palpable for me and for a lot of our family," the contrite chief executive told ABC's Good Morning America programme.
An online petition calling for Mr Munoz to resign had gained more than 60,000 signatures by Wednesday afternoon.
But when asked if he would stand down, he said: "No. I was hired to make United better and we've been doing that and that's what I'll continue to do."
Mr Dao was pulled off Sunday evening's flight from Chicago to Louisville, Kentucky, because the flight was fully booked, and the airline wanted to get four passengers to leave to make room for four staff members.
Mr Dao was left bloodied after law enforcement officials dragged him off the plane as he refused to leave.
The footage provoked international outrage and the Dao family issued a statement on Tuesday evening expressing gratitude for the "outpouring of support".
"This can never, will never happen again on a United Airlines flight," said Mr Munoz in Wednesday morning's television interview.
He was asked what the company would do in future if a seated passenger refused voluntarily to leave an overbooked plane based on the airline's compensation offer.
"We're not going to put a law enforcement official to take them off," he said. "To remove a booked, paid seated passenger, we can't do that."
Mr Munoz was asked if Mr Dao, who has been undergoing treatment at a Chicago hospital, was at fault.
The chief executive paused.
He said: "No. He can't be. He was a paying passenger sitting on our seat in our aircraft and no one should be treated that way. Period."

===Input Doc/Src: New Zealanders living in Australia for at least five years can apply if they earn the median wage or more, and pass security, character and health checks.
The "new pathway" means easier access to citizenship, which allows access to a range of welfare services.
The deal follows tensions over the deportation of New Zealand criminals under laws introduced last year.
These laws allow Australia to deport any foreigners sentenced to more than 12 months in jail.
Prime Minister Key previously said the issue was "undermining [a] special relationship".
"We traversed some of the concerns that we continue to have," he said in Sydney on Friday. "We appreciate the work that  [Australia has] been doing around ensuring that people can appeal those decisions."
Meanwhile, Mr Key formally extended the offer to take in some of the 267 asylum seekers awaiting deportation to Australia's offshore detention centre in Nauru.
"All I can simply say is the offer remains on the table," Mr Key said.
The Australian government is refusing to alter its border security policy, saying it is aimed at stopping the people smuggling trade.

===Input Doc/Src: US President Donald Trump's two adult sons, Donald Jr and Eric, were at the luxury hotel's grand opening.
About 200 protesters gathered outside the building to chant "dump Trump" before the noon ceremony.
The city's mayor and city council boycotted the event because of the president's controversial statements about immigrants.
Steel fences surrounded the downtown property early Tuesday ahead of the ceremony, but that didn't stop the demonstrations.
The words "hate lives here" were scrawled in chalk outside the CA$360m ($274m/Â£220m) luxury hotel, and people stuck anti-Trump sticky notes to the outside of the building.
Another protest was scheduled to take place in downtown Vancouver for 1600 local time (midnight GMT).
In a statement, the Vancouver police force said the safety of both those attending the event and the general public was a priority. They received help from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Protective Policing unit, which is responsible for the safety of "Internationally Protected Persons," such as the family of foreign officials.
A spokesperson for the RCMP declined to say how much security cost.
The  Canadian tower was designed by famed architect Arthur Erickson and had a soft launch last month. The building has a distinctive 45-degree twist as it rises upward and is the second-tallest building on the city's skyline.
Mr Trump's sons and his daughter Tiffany bypassed protestors by entering through the back, local media reported.
In a press conference in the hotel's grand ballroom, Eric Trump praised developer Joo Kim Tiah's efforts in getting the hotel and condominium project built.
"We love you, we love the relationship and we're going to have a lot of fun for many years to come," said Eric Trump.
He also said Vancouver was "truly one of the most beautiful places in the world" and "so fitting for the Trump brand".

===Input Doc/Src: It will feature in Sunday's first episode of the new series of the long-running programme, which was recorded at Tewkesbury Abbey in Gloucestershire.
Expert Fergus Gambon said it was "unique" and "one of the most important English baby houses in existence".
The doll's house was built in 1705 and is extremely well preserved.
In a first for the programme, a camera crew went to film at the home of the object's owner, after just a few dolls were taken to the recording, which took place in May.
Mr Gambon, who is the son of actor Sir Michael Gambon, said: "As soon as I saw the dolls I recognised the importance of it.
"And it is quite a large object, it's extraordinarily fragile, it's not something that you can just shove in the back of the car and bring over.
"So if we wanted to show the viewers what the house was like, this was really our only chance."
The doll's house is well preserved, with the dolls in their original clothes, and was made on the Isle of Dogs for a Miss E Westbrook.
It has been in the owner's family ever since, being passed down the female line for generations.
Mr Gambon said he had known of the existence of the doll's house after having seen photographs of it in a book from the 1950s.
"I saw the dolls first and I recognised them immediately from the pictures," he said.
"The extraordinary thing about the Westbrook is the fact that it's remained in the family since it was made, and it is essentially a little time capsule."
The Antiques Roadshow at Tewkesbury Abbey will be shown on Sunday August 28 at 20:00 BST on BBC One.

===Input Doc/Src: Warburton wants to use the spur of helping Blues qualify for Europe to secure his spot on the three-Test tour in June.
Four successive wins have put the Blues just a point outside the Pro12 top six.
"That is how I approach it, making it show that I am worthy of a place in the Welsh team," Warburton told BBC Wales.
The eighth-placed Blues have two games remaining, starting with the Judgement Day showdown with Ospreys on 30 April at the Principality Stadium.
They then visit direct rivals Edinburgh, currently sixth and a place ahead of Muster, on the final day of the campaign on 7 May.
"I have felt like the last two games for the Blues have been a trial for Wales if I am honest, there are some pretty big personal battles all across the field," Warburton said.
"You get a lot of respect for performing well in Welsh derbies, individually and as a team and for me personally, I have felt the need to prove myself all over again in a Blues shirt after the Six Nations.
"I still feel I have a point to prove when it comes to Welsh selection because I want to make sure you can go into the New Zealand tour, hopefully having your hand held up as one of the form players."
Dual contract star Warburton says a return to his beloved Blues has been the perfect way to get over Wales failing to win the Six Nations.
"I still felt I was chasing a little bit of match fitness. I was disappointed with the way the Six Nations went," he said,
"I did okay, but didn't do as well as I would have wanted and I really felt like I owed the Blues some big performances.
"Because I'd had two-and-a-half games after the World Cup and before the Six Nations, which isn't enough really and I just wanted to play a lot more rugby than that for the Blues.

===Input Doc/Src: Hilda Marcel died in 1987 from lung failure and her husband Eugenios died from prostate cancer seven years later.
Their mummified bodies were kept in a basement flat in the city's Gilmore Place, which was regularly visited by a son of the couple, until 2002.
Since their discovery, the bodies have been stored in the city's mortuary.
Edinburgh city council has been trying to get the family's consent to bury Mr and Mrs Marcel, but this has been repeatedly refused.
Now, almost 30 years after Mrs Marcel died, the council has lodged a petition at the Court of Session to seek permission to dispose of their bodies.
Prof Roderick Paisley from Aberdeen University's Law School said: "The wheels of justice do grind slowly, and they appear to be grinding incredibly slowly on this particular hearse.
"I think this should have been dealt with three or four years ago.
"I do appreciate there are sensitivities here, but the law is reasonably clear."
A police investigation was carried out when the bodies were found in 2002, but no charges were brought.
Death certificates had been correctly issued and the pair had died of natural causes.
Cameron Rose, leader of the Conservative group on Edinburgh City Council, said it was an "extraordinary story".
He added that there needed to be "sensitivity for the families".
The Court of Session has now agreed to hear the case, although so far no date has been set.

===Input Doc/Src: The man in charge of this is Yaakov Asulin. Every day he, along with at least two other supervisors, makes sure that the chefs and restaurant staff keep to meticulous standards when it comes to keeping kosher.
But he is not employed by the hotel. His boss instead is the Chief Rabbinate of Israel, the supreme religious body of Israel in charge of ruling over all religious matters including weddings and divorce.
"His job is very hard because he has to maintain all the workers and he has to check that everything is in place and on time and by the strict rules of kashrut," says Lannon Polon, the manager of Ramat Rachel Hotel.
"You can't mix cutlery, you can't mix certain products, of course we don't cook with milk and meat - most of the tourists, it's quite difficult for them.
"Most people in the world don't care, they eat meat and milk together and cheeseburger and ice-cream with steaks. We're conservative here."
The hotel pays the supervisors directly and it costs the hotel around 23,000 Israeli shekels ($6,100; Â£4,600) a month to employ them.
While keeping kosher is a religious issue, it has also become a contentious economic and political concern in Israel, with some restaurateurs saying the religious authorities are exerting too much power over business.
Rabbi Aaron Lebowitz founded the Alternative Kosher Supervision Project. They also have inspectors but say they offer better service at a fraction of the cost.
"Over the years in Israel, the monopoly that the Chief Rabbinate has, has bred corruption at worst and even at best there's no competition," he says.
"Because there's no competition, the quality of service, the quality of supervision and also the cost are not competitive and are not of high quality.

===Input Doc/Src: Emily Titterington had not been to the toilet for three months when she suffered a cardiac arrest at home.
An inquest heard the condition was so bad that some body parts had been displaced, including her diaphragm.
The Coroner for Cornwall concluded the cause of death was "natural causes contributed by psycho-social factors".
Summing up, Dr Emma Carlyon said it could have been prevented.
"Something went wrong with the patient-parent-professional triangle which meant she did not get the care she needed," she said.
Paramedics described their "shock" at Emily's "grossly extended abdomen" when she collapsed at St Austell in February 2013 and said she was "vomiting faeces".
The inquest was told that Emily, who was home-educated, had a history of constipation that could be linked to her anxiety and mild autism.
Her sister Hannah Herbert raised concerns about the impact "parental anxieties" had on her, and said she had warned social services "something terrible might happen" the year before.
Her brother-in-law Brian Herbert told the inquest Emily's decision not to be examined or go to hospital would have been influenced by the fact her parents "could not cope" with that.
However Emily's GP, Dr Alistair James, said her mother Geraldine Titterington had tried to persuade her to be examined and he found no evidence of safeguarding issues.
Consultant paediatrician Dr Paul Davis said "self-neglect" played a part in her death but she should have been persuaded to go to hospital.
A serious case review by Cornwall Council's Safeguarding Children Board has made several recommendations including that agencies share concerns raised by a family member.
Dr Carlyon said she was satisfied "most of the recommendations have been actioned and embedded".

Russian naval ships were also spotted in the area at the same time, Japanese local media said.
In 2012, relations between Japan and China deteriorated after Japan bought the islands from a private owner.
The islands are important because they are close to key shipping lanes, offer rich fishing grounds and lie near potential oil and gas reserves.
Reacting to the incident, Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga expressed "serious concern" at a news conference, saying it would escalate tensions.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has told his government to work closely with the US and other countries to deal with this, Mr Suga said.
How uninhabited islands soured China-Japan ties
"Around 00:50 am (15:30 GMT Wednesday), a Chinese naval vessel entered our nation's contiguous waters surrounding the Senkaku Islands," the Japanese foreign ministry said in a statement.
Japan's Vice-Foreign Minister Akitaka Saiki summoned China's ambassador Cheng Yonghua to lodge a protest.
Mr Saiki told the ambassador that the Senkakus are an inherent part of Japan's territory, in terms of history and international law, NHK reported.
He demanded the vessel swiftly move away from the area. Local media reported the vessel left the area around 03:10 local time.
Mr Cheng said the Chinese frigate was allowed to sail in those waters, said Kyodo news agency citing an unnamed source.
Three Russian military vessels were also seen in the waters around the disputed islands, according to Jiji Press, entering around 21:50 on Wednesday and leaving around 03:05 on Thursday.

Magala is no stranger to the ...Got Talent format, having previously appeared on the US, French, Italian, Russian and Ukrainian versions of the show.

===Input Doc/Src: The rise of the far-left Podemos party and centrist Citizens means the next general election, at the end of this year, is set to be a four-horse race.
For over three decades the Socialists (PSOE) and centre-right Popular Party (PP) have alternated in power, accounting for over 70% of the vote in past general elections.
But the impact of austerity policies and a focus on corruption has created unprecedented uncertainty.
And the "indignant" protest movement, which camped out in Madrid's central square in the summer of 2011, changed the nation's viewpoint on corruption.
The shift has been highlighted by an opinion poll that puts the one-year-old Podemos in the lead on 22.5%, the Socialists second with 20.2%, the PP third on 18.6% and Citizens, or Cs as the party has branded itself, with 18.4%.
A former PP treasurer revealed wholesale illegal financing of his party while the Socialist regional government in Andalusia oversaw a fraud totalling hundreds of millions of euros diverted from funds meant to help the unemployed.
Both are now stuck with the label of "la casta" (the caste), a term coined to great effect by Podemos.
Podemos is the brainchild of a group of leftist political science university lecturers, headed by gifted orator Pablo Iglesias.
Only four months after they were founded, they attracted 8% share of the vote in last May's European elections.
Podemos argues Spain's crisis was a swindle on the part of the country's financial and political elite and vows to renegotiate its debt to its creditors in the same way as Greece's radical Syriza government is doing.
Under Podemos, evictions of homeowners would be halted and welfare guaranteed for families hit by Spain's 24% unemployment rate.
"We didn't set up Podemos to become like the PSOE or PP - historical parties for our children and grandchildren to join as heirs of the founders," says the party's chief political analyst, Carolina Bescansa, a university lecturer.

Prime Minister David Cameron wrote on Facebook: "We've lost a huge figure of post-war politics. A hero in World War Two as Beach Master at Anzio and a brave politician, Denis Healey told his party hard truths about Britain having to live within her means."
Lord Healey served as an MP for Leeds for 40 years from 1952 before joining the House of Lords in 1992.
A defining moment in his career came in 1976 when, as chancellor, he applied for an emergency loan from the the International Monetary Fund in an effort to save the pound from collapse.

===Input Doc/Src: The targeted area is controlled by the so-called Islamic State group and has been under heavy bombardment from government-aligned forces.
Dozens of people are said to have been killed during the combined assaults.
IS members recaptured the city on Sunday, hours after Russian air strikes appeared to have driven them back.
Sources in Hama province reported seeing dead bodies with no visible injuries, according to the UK-based group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
The death toll was put at at least 40 by one citizens' group in Hama province.
The Syrian government and its Russian backers have previously denied using chemical weapons.
IS was previously driven out of the ancient desert city of Palmyra in March with the support of Russian air strikes, but the jihadist group seized it again in a sudden assault that started last week.
The surprise setback for Syrian government forces came as they and their allies turned their attention to fighting local opposition forces in Aleppo and Damascus.
IS destroyed a number of monuments and beheaded the archaeological director during its 10-month occupation of the Unesco World Heritage site and the adjacent city of Tadmur.
Two 2,000-year-old temples, an arch and funerary towers were left in ruins.
The jihadist group, which has also demolished several pre-Islamic sites in neighbouring Iraq, believes that such structures are idolatrous.

===Input Doc/Src: Pathologist Prof Guy Rutty said David "Les" Ross, 39, had probably been rolled "in a foetal position" when he was attacked on 17 December 2012 at Corby's Village Inn Express.
Sitting at Kettering Magistrates' Court, coroner Anne Pember recorded a verdict of "unlawful killing".
Mr Ross's family said his death was "a senseless act of violence".
Northamptonshire Police are treating his death as murder and an investigation is ongoing. No-one from the force attended the inquest.
Mrs Pember said Mr Ross was well known in Corby, where he had previously worked as a taxi driver and nightclub bouncer, and had opened the Rubix nightclub in the weeks before he died.
Leanne Martin, who worked at the Village Inn Express in The Jamb, told the inquest Mr Ross had asked to stay in the hotel because his own house in Chelveston Drive had been broken into.
Another worker at the hotel, Paige Lindsay, said she had discovered Mr Ross's body "on his back with his feet towards the door".
Paramedic Michael Rowlatt told the inquest Mr Ross had been wearing boxer shorts and a white vest or t-shirt. He said there had been blood on the carpet and on the bed side cabinet.
Prof Rutty said Mr Ross had injuries to his face, chest and arms. He said some of the wounds might have been from a fight the previous night, but that others were caused by a "ring on a fist".
A statement from his family said they are "torn apart with grief" by an attack "carried out in a cowardly manner".
It said: "There are people still walking around in Corby who know what happened to David, who attacked him and why."

===Input Doc/Src: It is the last day of the Indian prime minister's tour of China and he is meeting some of the heads of Chinese industry. He will be hoping that they will be able to drive forward his signature policy, 'Make in India'.
But one year into his term as prime minister and many say Mr Modi is showing some distinctly undemocratic tendencies as he tries to foster a manufacturing boom in India.
At the end of April, India cancelled the registration of nearly 9,000 foreign-funded non-governmental organisations (NGOs), saying they didn't comply with the country's tax codes.
And the Indian government has singled out the environmental pressure group, Greenpeace, for special attention.
The reason why says a lot, both about Mr Modi's ambitions for India and his attitude to dissent.
This week Greenpeace won a small victory.
On Wednesday the government lifted its ban on activist Priya Pillai travelling abroad.
In January she was stopped from travelling to the UK to testify to British MPs about the effects of coal mining in India.
But the war is far from over.
The charity says it will have to close down in a matter of weeks unless the Indian government lifts the financial freeze it has imposed on the NGO.
A secret report from India's Intelligence Bureau, leaked last year, explains why India's government has such a beef with the environmental charity.
It said campaigns headed by Greenpeace and other NGOs had drained three percentage points off the nation's annual growth rate.
Greenpeace wouldn't claim to have been anywhere near that influential but its campaign against the coal industry does strike at the heart of the 'Make in India' policy.
Coal is the main source of power in India and is central to the BJP government's plans to boost industrial production.
It is also the most polluting of all fossil fuels and a key driver of climate change.
And, when it comes to coal, India compares poorly even with China, as Mr Modi's visit highlights.
China's coal use of coal has been falling steepl

===Input Doc/Src: Francis Cadell's depiction of ''George Street and Charlotte Square'' was whitewashed over and the canvas was reused by the son of another colourist, Samuel Peploe.
The Scottish Gallery in Edinburgh discovered the missing Cadell during conservation.
It is estimated that the painting could sell for more than Â£50,000.
The Scottish Colourists were four post-impressionist painters, Peploe and Cadell, along with John Leslie Hunter and John Duncan Fergusson.
They absorbed and reworked the strong and vibrant colours of contemporary French painting into a distinctive Scottish idiom during the 1920s and 1930s.
The lost Cadell work was painted around 1909 from his studio at 112 George Street, Edinburgh, and looks across the street to Charlotte Square.
When the artist died in 1937, his sister Jean Percival Clark, well-known as the actress Jean Cadell, came up to Edinburgh to sort out his affairs.
She was helped by Denis Peploe, son of Samuel, who was a student at Edinburgh College of Art.
She gifted him some of her brother's art material and included among the canvases, probably including "George Street and Charlotte Square", taken off its stretcher, turned and re-stretched ready to be used again.
It is not known why Cadell abandoned the painting, which is finished and bears a strong signature.
Years later, Denis Peploe painted his own picture, Begonias, a still life on a trestle table and whitewashed over the Cadell exposed on the other side.
The Scottish Gallery acquired the Denis Peploe and in the process of conservation discovered the Cadell on the reverse.
Denis's son, Guy, who is director of the Scottish Gallery, told BBC Scotland that he had bought the painting at auction and was shocked when he got a call from the picture conservator.
"He said 'I think there's something interesting on the other side of the picture'.
"I said go-ahead take it off its stretcher and see what we can see. He called back a few minutes later and said 'bottom left hand corner, signature FCB Cad

===Input Doc/Src: The bidding is slow and stuttering. "All that wait for nothing," mutters the auctioneer as a telephone bidder thinks long and hard about a making a higher offer before changing his mind.
Most works sell at the low end of their estimated price range. Constable's The Lock, for instance, fetches $13.5m (Â£9.1m) when it was estimated to sell for as much as $17.8m.
It is an oddly subdued end to the year, because the headlines in the media were suggesting that in 2015 the art market caught fire.
In May, Picasso's Les Femmes d'Alger, Version O, sold at Christie's in New York for $179.3m (Â£120.6m). Bidders in the auction room erupted in applause: it is the highest price ever paid for a work at auction.
Then, in November, a Chinese businessman paid $170.4m for Modigliani's Nu Couche (Reclining Nude) - the second-highest price ever fetched at auction.
However, 2015 also saw seen many auction flops. Claude Monet's Nympheas sold for $33.8m, well below its top estimate of $50m and Andy Warhol's Four Marilyns sold for $36m rather than the expected $40m.
It seems that many of the world's millionaires are now feeling worried about the future, and are opting to keep their wealth in cash.
This is particularly true of rich Chinese, who now make up a fifth of the world's buyers of art.
Turbulence on the Shanghai stock exchange in 2015, an economic slowdown and tough anti-corruption laws have persuaded many to stop splashing out on art.
"At the very, very top of the market - amongst billionaires who are really keen to get a great work by a really famous-name artist like Picasso - there is still a lot of competition", says Jane Morris, editor of The Art Newspaper, based in London.
"Once you go under that, where we're talking prices in the millions of dollars, people are feeling more squeezed.
"There's much less confidence in the Chinese market. The Russians are feeling much poorer. People in general are feeling poorer, and that has had an impact."
The biggest impact of all has been on t

===Input Doc/Src: The Australian and Malaysian governments say the search will now focus on an area 1,100km (684 miles) north-east of the previous zone.
The move was based on further analysis of radar data that showed the plane was going faster, thus using more fuel.
The Beijing-bound airliner disappeared on 8 March with 239 people on board.
Malaysian officials have concluded that, based on satellite data, it flew into the sea somewhere in the southern Indian Ocean. So far no trace of it has been found.
Search efforts had until Friday morning focused on an area some 2,500km (1,550 miles) to the south-west of the Australian city of Perth.
Did previous photos show plane debris?
Using satellite images, several nations have identified objects floating in the sea in that search area, but these have not been located and there is no evidence that they are related to the plane.
John Young, general manager of Amsa's emergency response division, said that teams had "moved on" from that area based on the new information.
Acting Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said that the fact that the search area had moved did not discount the earlier satellite images of possible debris further south.
"Because of ocean drift, this new search area could still be consistent with the potential objects identified by various satellite images over the past week," Mr Hussein said.
A statement from Amsa - which is co-ordinating the search - said the new information had come from the international investigation team in Malaysia.
This was based on "continuing analysis of radar data between the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca before radar contact was lost", Amsa said.
"It indicated that the aircraft was travelling faster than previously estimated, resulting in increased fuel usage and reducing the possible distance the aircraft travelled south into the Indian Ocean."
It said that the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) had determined that this was "the most credible lead to where debris

===Input Doc/Src: The Swede, 35, joined Jose Mourinho's side last summer on a one-year deal and has scored 20 goals this season.
Mourinho said on Friday he believed the club's top scorer would still be at Old Trafford in 2017-18.
When asked about his future, Ibrahimovic said: "We'll wait and see."
Ibrahimovic's goals have helped Manchester United into the EFL Cup final - where they will face Southampton - as well as the fifth round of the FA Cup. The Red Devils are also in the Europa League knockout stage.
Manchester United won the Community Shield in August and Ibrahimovic is confident of adding at least one more trophy to the collection.
"We have one and we can get our second one," he added.
"We are still in the Europa League and FA Cup, so if we don't become champions in the Premier League at least we can try and win two or three trophies."

===Input Doc/Src: The new regulations - which permit drilling from outside the protected areas - were approved by 298 to 261.
Opposition parties and campaigners criticised the lack of a Commons debate - and accused ministers of a U-turn as they previously pledged an outright ban on fracking in national parks.
The government said its plans would protect "our most precious landscapes".
Energy Minister Andrea Leadsom also said there had already been "enormous debate" on the subject.
MPs overwhelmingly rejected a bid to suspend drilling for shale gas in a Commons vote in January, during which ministers also pledged an "outright ban" on fracking in national parks.
Labour has said the government's plans, contained in a draft regulation, represent a U-turn on this commitment, and called for stronger safeguards.
The proposals, first set out in July, would only allow fracking 1,200m below national parks, Areas of Outstanding National Beauty, the Norfolk and Suffolk Broads and World Heritage Sites.
The drill rigs would have to be positioned outside the boundaries of the protected areas.
Q&A: What is fracking?
Sites of Special Scientific Interest, which are designated to protect wildlife or geology, are not mentioned.
MPs opposed the passing of the draft regulation when it was read out in the Commons on Tuesday evening. Because this happened after the conclusion of the day's main business, parliamentary rules required the vote to be deferred - until Wednesday.
Under this process of so-called deferred divisions, MP voted on the proposal by filling in ballot papers with the result announced later by Deputy Speaker Natascha Engel.
Shadow energy secretary Lisa Nandy accused ministers of using a "parliamentary backdoor" to try to approve the "weak regulations" without debate.
She said: "Fracking should not go ahead in Britain until stronger safeguards are in place to protect drinking water sources and sensitive parts of our countryside like national parks."

===Input Doc/Src: Mr Hayes, 71, spent three months making and decorating the framework which contains 128 pots of home-grown blooms.
"It was supposed to be 40ft high but the wife wouldn't let me go any higher," said Mr Hayes, who also built his own home.
The tower is made up of six box sections welded and stacked on top of each other and tethered to a wall.
Mr Hayes spends three hours twice a week weeding and watering his upwardly mobile flower be, and has already given it a replanting makeover.
The part-time office furniture salesman said he thought up the project when he was left with a surplus of steel struts after recycling some office desks.
"My wife loves it to bits, so do all my neighbours," he said.
"The reason I'm proud of it is it's a one-off, it looks beautiful and I didn't need any help to make it, everything was done by me, nobody even handed me even a spanner."
With its overhanging cover, the pots in Mr Hayes's flower tower each contain five different plants.
Initially, they had daffodils and tulips but when those died out he replaced them with fuchsias, geraniums, pansies and others.
The couple live in the bungalow Mr Hayes built over three levels himself almost 40 years ago.
He has also worked as a window builder and fitter and has done odd jobs throughout his life.
Mr Hayes moved to Newport from Iraq when he was 19.
His father was an engineer but Mr Hayes says he is totally self taught.
He said: "If you can't think how to do it, think harder!"
"Some say "Jack of all trades but master of none" but I don't believe in that saying - I would challenge any plasterer, any welder."

===Input Doc/Src: Police said the tanker, transporting fuel to Nato forces in Afghanistan, was hit by a bomb overnight near the town of Landi Kotal in the Khyber region.
People gathered to collect spilt fuel when another fire broke out, said one senior police official.
At least 14 other Nato tankers were damaged in  a separate attack nearby, at the Torkham border crossing.
The region is a crucial transport route for supplies destined for Nato forces in Afghanistan but the convoys frequently come under attack from militants and criminals.
Local official Shafeerullah Wazir said the tanker was hit by a small bomb in the early hours of the morning.
"The oil tanker caught fire after a blast caused by a small bomb before dawn," the AFP news agency quoted him as saying.
"Villagers from nearby houses rushed and started collecting oil coming out of the destroyed tanker after the fire had been extinguished.
"Suddenly the fire erupted again and at least 15 people including five young boys who had been collecting oil in their buckets were burnt to death."
There were no injuries at the separate attack at Torkham.
No group has claimed responsibility for the attacks, but there has been an increase in Taliban activity since al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden was killed in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad on 2 May.
In the deadliest incident, more than 80 people were killed by a twin suicide bombing targeting police recruits in the north-west.
On Friday, one person was killed and 10 injured when the Taliban attacked a US consulate convoy in Peshawar - the first attack on US interests since US commandos killed Bin Laden.

===Input Doc/Src: David Rees, who chairs the assembly's health committee, said it was "unable to reach a consensus view" on the idea.
The five Labour members supported curbs on e-cigarettes, claiming their use "normalises" smoking behaviour.
The idea was opposed by four opposition AMs, while Plaid Cymru's Elin Jones suggested imposing less stringent restrictions than those on tobacco.
As the Labour Welsh government does not have an outright majority in the Senedd, it will need some opposition support to get the measure passed as part of the Public Health (Wales) Bill.
The plan, intended to come into force in 2017 and the first in the UK, has divided opinion among health and medical groups.
Some anti-smoking campaigners have opposed restrictions, saying e-cigarettes help smokers kick the habit.
But Health Minister Mark Drakeford has said it is a "balance of risk", claiming restrictions on e-cigarettes will deter children from smoking.
In a report on Monday, the committee said it agreed with the bill's other proposals, including a licensing scheme for tattoo and piercing parlours, and a ban on intimate piercings for under 16s.
---Sum/Tgt: Plans to ban the use of e-cigarettes in enclosed public places have divided a group of AMs looking at the proposal.

===Input Doc/Src: Fridays Ltd, which produces thousands of free range eggs in Cranbrook, wants to expand its operation in Horsmonden.
Residents fear the extra traffic and noise from the 32-hectare site will have a detrimental impact on the area.
The company said it was responding to a 5% year-on-year increase in demand for free range eggs.
The family-run business is one of the three biggest egg producers and packers in the country.
If agreed, its new chicken farm would be located at Pullens Farm, in Lamberhurst Road, which is on the outskirts of the village of Horsmonden.
Resident Sarah Overton said: "The sheer scale of this development is extraordinary.
"We're talking the equivalent of 80 football pitches, 64,000 birds at any one time producing 360,000 eggs a week, using mechanical processes and only needing one full-time person to look after them, and three part-time egg collectors.
"It equates to industrialisation in the countryside, which is bad enough, but this is industrialisation of an area of outstanding natural beauty with protected species that we all need to be careful to preserve," she said.
Fridays Ltd has lodged its application with Tunbridge Wells Borough Council, with a provisional decision expected in August.

Men's holder Pollock will not compete in the Belfast race.
Pollock has opted to return to his regular training base in London ahead of the European Cross Country tests.
The Holywood man was third in the men's race an Santry which represented his first competitive outing since running the Berlin Marathon in September.
Pollock went into the Irish European trials as the defending champion but he insisted that he was content with his third place on his return to racing after his Berlin disappointment.
The medical doctor achieved the Olympics marathon standard in Berlin but was only the fourth Irishman over the finish line in the German capital which means he will have to race again in the spring if he wants to achieve his Rio ambition.
In his regular blog, the latest instalment of which was published earlier this week, Pollock revealed that, after the suggestion of his coach Andy Hobdell, he opted to take several weeks off following his Berlin exertions.
The Santry race represented Pollock's return to competitive action and his target was to secure the top-three finish which would guarantee a sixth appearance at the European Cross Country Championships
"On each of the previous five attempts at the Europeans I have run poorly, having peaked for the Irish trials," said Pollock in his blog.
"This year however, I know that, at least, I will be in better shape than what I was at Santry.
"With three weeks of hard training ahead of me and the knowledge that my fitness should come back quickly, the nerves are already setting in.
"This championship is an unexpected but very welcome bonus. The bigger races will come in the Springtime.
"For now however, it is time to focus on the task at hand. The Irish vest is an extremely special thing to wear and come 13 December, I want to run well."

===Input Doc/Src: Canon Bill Brassell from Gloucester served in the Royal Navy in the 1940s, and battled storms, bombers and U-boats to ferry war supplies to Russia.
He has been awarded the Arctic Star medal for the maritime missions, which Winston Churchill said were the most dangerous of the war.
"I'm very, very grateful to receive this," he told the BBC.
"It's only 70 years I suppose, and at last it's happened. Not just because it's a nice thing for me, but because of all those who served with me and they paid the supreme sacrifice.
"Of all the bits that one served during the war, this was the effort that was made by so many.
"I take it [medal] very much in memory of all those who didn't come back, all my shipmates, and that's something that I will very much treasure".
The medal presentation took place at the headquarters of Gloucester-based A Company 6 Rifles.
In 2005, an Arctic badge was awarded to the veterans of the convoys but they felt that it did not go far enough.
They lobbied the government for a specific medal to recognise the service of those involved in the mission.
The Arctic Star medal was created this year.
"This is a medal that we've introduced to honour those people who served on the Arctic convoys in World War II," said Conservative MP Mark Francois, the minister of state for defence personnel, welfare and veterans.
"I'm privileged to present this to Canon Brassell."
The Arctic convoys brought crucial supplies and weapons to Russia, to help fight off Hitler's armies.
The icy voyages claimed over 3,000 lives and Winston Churchill described them as the worst journey in the world.
The supply ships were under constant threat of attack by German U-boats and aircraft and also had to negotiate severe cold, storms, and ice floes.
The voyages began in 1941 and by May 1945, the Arctic route had claimed 104 merchant ships and 16 military vessels.

===Input Doc/Src: The bus was travelling to the Monastery of St Samuel the Confessor, 135km (85 miles) south of Cairo, from Minya province when it came under fire.
No group immediately said it was behind the attack.
But Islamic State (IS) militants have targeted Copts several times in recent months, and vowed to do so again.
Two suicide bombings at Palm Sunday services at churches in the northern cities of Alexandria and Tanta on 9 April left 46 people dead.
Another suicide bombing at a church in the capital in December killed 29 people, while a Christian community was forced to flee the town of el-Arish in the northern Sinai peninsula after a series of gun attacks in February.
The Copts killed on Friday had been travelling to St Samuel's monastery to pray.
Their bus was in a small convoy that was stopped on a desert road near Adwa police station by between eight and 10 gunmen wearing military uniforms, officials cited witnesses as saying. The gunmen then fired at the bus with automatic weapons before fleeing in three 4x4 vehicles, they added.
A Christian official in Minya, Ibram Samir, told the New York Times that children had been on the bus and were among the dead.
Mr Samir said a pick-up truck carrying workmen at the monastery was also in the convoy. It is not clear whether it was targeted as well.
Minya governor Essam al-Bedawi said security forces had arrived at the scene and were fanning out along the road to the monastery and setting up checkpoints.
Copts make up about 10% of Egypt's population of 92 million.
Last month's attacks prompted President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi to declare a three-month nationwide state of emergency and promise to do whatever was necessary to confront jihadist militants, most of whom are based in northern Sinai.
But many Copts complain that the Egyptian authorities are not doing enough to protect them, says the BBC's Orla Guerin in Cairo.
There is now a real sense of fear, and a feeling of being hunted, she adds.

But the scene of the deadliest ever attack carried out by so-called Islamic State (IS) anywhere in the world is still a makeshift shrine. On 3 July, 292 Iraqis lost their lives here.
This week, the haunting strains of a cello wafted through the cavernous black hulks where two popular centres once drew in Iraqis for shopping and socialising.
"If terrorists are trying to turn every element of life into a battlefield, I will turn it into a field of beauty and civilisation," declares Karim Wasifi, composer and conductor with Iraq's National Symphony Orchestra.
He has played his cello at other major bomb sites in Baghdad as an affirmation of Iraqis' determination to fight back.
Hardly a day goes by without an attack somewhere in a city laced with security checkpoints and armed guards.
But the explosion in Baghdad's Karrada neighbourhood was no ordinary bomb. From its design to its destination, this attack underlines that IS has found a new way to inflict harm and cause terror.
"Daesh used, for the first time, a new tactic which helped it to move undetected through checkpoints," a Western security source in Baghdad tells me, using the name for IS more commonly used in the region.
"We've never seen it before, and it's very worrying."
Precise details of the attack, which is under Iraqi investigation, are still being pieced together.
The tactic known as a VBIED - vehicle-borne improvised explosive device - is now widely used in suicide bombings.
But this one is said to differ in the way the explosives were placed in the van, and how the chemicals were put together.
"It's really difficult to make," an explosives expert who has knowledge of the investigation explained, saying the device may have been developed in the Iraqi city of Falluja when it was under IS control.
"Daesh has given a lot of thought to how to move through checkpoints."

===Input Doc/Src: A police officer told the BBC that two people were killed after a gunman believed to be the killer of a policewoman in Montrouge entered the supermarket near Porte de Vincennes.
Armed police have flooded the area.
In Dammartin-en-Goele, 35km (22 miles) north-east of Paris, the Charlie Hebdo suspects are also holding a hostage.
The Islamist militants are inside a small printing business and have reportedly said they are prepared to die.
Twelve people were shot dead and 11 were injured in Wednesday's attack on the office of Charlie Hebdo, a satirical magazine which freely mocks religion.
The unprecedented attack shocked France and there has been an outpouring of sympathy and solidarity worldwide.
Armed anti-terror teams have surrounded the Hypercacher supermarket on avenue de la Porte de Vincennes in eastern Paris, where a gunman is said to be holding five hostages.
He knew at least one of the suspected Charlie Hebdo attackers, brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi, a source told AFP news agency.
The gunman has threatened to kill his captives if police seek to capture the brothers, reports citing police say.
Schools near the supermarket are under lockdown.
Separately police have ordered the closure of all shops in the Marais, a traditionally Jewish area in the heart of Paris's central tourist district.
The gunman in eastern Paris is also suspected to be behind the shooting of a policewoman in the southern suburb of Montrouge on Thursday.
French police have issued an appeal for witnesses to that shooting. They said they were looking for two people: a man called Amedy Coulibaly, 32, and a woman called Hayat Boumeddiene, 26.
The two were thought to be "armed and dangerous", French police said.
The Charlie Hebdo attackers, linked by intelligence officials to militant groups, shouted Islamist slogans during the shooting at the magazine office on Wednesday and then fled Paris in a hijacked car, heading north.
Shots were fired during a high-speed car chase earlier on Friday.

===Input Doc/Src: Physics suggests equal amounts of matter and antimatter should have been made in the Big Bang.
In 2010, researchers at the Tevatron accelerator claimed preliminary results showing a small excess of matter over antimatter as particles decayed.
The team has submitted a paper showing those results are on a firmer footing.
Each of the fundamental particles known has an antimatter cousin, with identical properties but opposite electric charge.
When a particle encounters its antiparticle, they "annihilate" each other, disappearing in a high-energy flash of light.
The question remains: why did this not occur in the early Universe with the equal amounts of matter and antimatter, resulting in a Universe devoid of both?
The Tevatron results come from a shower of particles produced at the facility when smashing protons into their antimatter counterparts, antiprotons.
The proton-antiproton collisions in turn create a number of different particles, and the team operating the Tevatron's DZero detector first noticed a discrepancy in the decay of particles called B mesons.
These decayed into pairs of particles called muons alongside pairs of their antimatter versions, antimuons. But, as the team reported in May 2010 in a paper published in Physical Review Letters, there was a notable 1% excess of the matter particles.
However, unpicking important events in the soup of interactions created in particle physics experiments meant that those measurements were associated with a level of uncertainty - reflecting the probability that the effect they see is a random statistical occurrence, rather than new physics.
The researchers now have 50% more data to work with, and have tried to establish that their earlier result in fact came from the particle decays that they first proposed.
As they reported this Thursday, they have now reduced the uncertainty in their experiment to a level of "3.9 sigma", or 3.9 standard deviations - equivalent to a 0.005% probability that the effect is a fluke.
But

===Input Doc/Src: The four-match contest should have begun in Brisbane on Thursday, but that Test will now start on 17 December.
The traditional Melbourne Boxing Day Test is unchanged, but the Sydney Test is put back three days to 6 January.
The changes have been made because of welfare concerns for Australia's players grieving for Hughes, 25, whose funeral will take place on Wednesday.
The left-handed Australia opener died on Thursday after being struck on the neck by a ball during a domestic Sheffield Shield match.
The funeral service will take place in the sports hall of Macksville High School, which Hughes attended, and will be broadcast live in Australia and on big screens at the Sydney Cricket Ground and Adelaide Oval.
"Nobody should underestimate just what these players are going through right now," said Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland.
"These are difficult days and we need to support them in dealing with their grief. It's very clear that playing a Test right now is just too soon and we are reacting accordingly.
"While this wasn't done by design, it is somewhat fitting that the first Test will take place in Adelaide at Phillip's adopted home ground where we hope the match can be a seen as a celebration of his life."
The India squad, currently in Adelaide, were supposed to fly to Brisbane on Monday but missed their flight.
Their two-day warm-up match against a Cricket Australia XI in Adelaide, scheduled for Friday and Saturday last week, was cancelled.
It has been reported that the Indians may now play a tour game in Adelaide on Thursday and Friday.
After the Test series with India, Australia then face the tourists in a triangular one-day international series that also involves England.
Two of those games have already been switched.
Australia and England will now open the series in Sydney on 16 January, with the Aussies taking on India in Melbourne two days later.

===Input Doc/Src: Claire Darbyshire, 36, killed 67-year-old Brian at their home in Wykeham Green, Dagenham, east London, on 2 September last year.
Afterwards, she claimed they had made a suicide pact as his illness had become "intolerable".
But following an Old Bailey trial, a jury found Darbyshire guilty of murder.
Sentencing her, Recorder of London Nicholas Hilliard QC said he accepted that she believed it was an act of mercy.
He said the key to the case was that she failed to establish her father had agreed she would also kill herself in a suicide pact.
He said: "I accept your evidence that your father did raise the question of ending his own life and he wanted to do that and wanted your help to do so."
But he told her she had unlawfully killed her father behind "closed doors" and no defence to murder applied.
Darbyshire, who was born male but has lived her life as a female, has already spent five months on remand in a men's prison awaiting trial.
Widower Mr Darbyshire developed MS in 1995 and in 2014 the defendant took over as his sole carer.
Prosecutor Jonathan Rees QC told jurors that Mr Darbyshire, a retired Ford stock controller, had not expressed any suicidal thoughts or complained about being in pain to nurses who visited him.
Medical records revealed he had episodes of "bad temper and aggression", but had never tried to kill himself.
Darbyshire complained to a friend about having to look after him and appeared to be stressed.
After the killing she caught a train to the Dover area, having texted the district nurse to visit "asap".
On 3 September, Darbyshire approached a National Trust worker on cliffs for help and ended up with support services in Canterbury.
Five days later she mentioned the suicide pact for the first time. She said they had both taken an overdose on 1 September, which failed to work, before she suffocated her father.
On the morning of 10 September - eight days after the killing - police discovered Mr Darbyshire's body in his bed with a suit, teddy bear an

===Input Doc/Src: Her department suggested schools could withdraw places offered to children if their families were found to be living in the country illegally.
The Home Office also wanted schools to carry out immigration checks.
Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said the plan was "disgusting".
'Not government policy'
Chief Inspector of schools Sir Michael Wilshaw said he was "amazed and shocked" by the claim - while Liberal Democrat education spokesman John Pugh dismissed it as "a grubby little idea".
But immigration minister Robert Goodwill insisted that deprioritising school places for children of people in the UK illegally is "not the policy of the government".
The government said it would not comment on leaked documents, but added that it was right that a range of options would be considered before ministers made a final decision.
By law, children under 16 have a right to an education whatever their parents' circumstances.
But the documents suggested the Home Office wanted schools to ask to see passports before accepting new pupils.
In summer 2015, Theresa May wanted Whitehall departments to contribute to the government's ambition to reduce immigration to the tens of thousands.
One source says every department was to have its hands "dipped in blood". But the letters reveal there was a "disquiet among our own ministers about the potential for inflammatory comparisons" by using schools as part of the immigration system, punishing the children of illegal immigrants by putting them to the bottom of the list for school places.
After discussions at a cabinet committee, Nicky Morgan, then education secretary, wrote twice to the then Prime Minister David Cameron with "profound concerns" about the Home Office's plan for schools.
It is not clear how wide-ranging the plans were, but the Department of Education is only responsible for schools in England.

===Input Doc/Src: It has announced that loans made to students in England between 2002 and 2006 will be put up for sale - to be followed by other pre-2012 loans - with the aim of raising £12bn.
Universities Minister Jo Johnson said the sale would have "no impact on people with student loans".
But the National Union of Students said it was an "ugly move on students".
"It is outrageous that bankers will profit off the backs of graduates who took out loans because they had no other option," said the union's vice-president Sorana Vieru.
The government has had a long-standing aim to sell the student loan book to private investors - with types of loans being sold in separate stages.
Over the next four years it aims to dispose of the loans from before 2012, when tuition fees in England were trebled to £9,000 per year.
The slice of loans now being put on sale - dating from 2002 to 2006 - have a face value of £4bn.
The government is promising that there will be "no changes to the terms and conditions" for borrowers - so that rates of repayment for former students will remain the same.
It means that interest on these student loans will become an income for private investors, but repayments will continue to be collected through taxation and the Student Loans Company.
The Intergenerational Foundation think tank has calculated that a student borrowing for three years' tuition could pay back £54,000 - before debts are cancelled after 30 years.
The Universities Minister Jo Johnson says the sale of assets is part of the drive to bring "public finances under control".
But he said it would "only proceed once we are satisfied that it represents value for money for the taxpayer".
David Gauke, chief secretary to the Treasury, said it was the right time to start the sale process.
"This sale makes sense for taxpayers and will play an important contribution in our work to repair the public finances," he said.
But John Pugh, the Liberal Democrats education spokesman, said: "The Conservative Brexit fire-sale

===Input Doc/Src: The Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish administrations have their spending level dictated by the Barnett formula.
Under it, extra funding or cuts for England has an affect on the other nations, dependent on their population size and the powers devolved to them.
Stormont's finance committee says parts of the formula could be more open.
That could include requiring the Treasury to publish data upon which Barnett-related decisions are based.
As an example, the committee pointed to the initial Treasury decision to classify infrastructure spending on the London Olympics as having UK-wide rather than England-only benefits.
That meant there were was no so-called consequential spending for the devolved governments.
The devolved nations did eventually get extra spending, but only about Â£30m rather than the Â£330m they thought they were due.
Some expert witnesses suggested that an independent body, such as the Office for Budget Responsibility, should be given an oversight role.
Prof Gerry Holtham, who produced a report on funding and financing in Wales, told the committee that Northern Ireland would benefit from the formula "being put on a proper statutory basis with an element of independence from Treasury introduced".
The committee also said that the executive should take "pre-emptive measures" for the event that the government decides to dispense with or alter the Barnett formula.
It said this could include piloting a new needs-based formula and developing a "fully considered position" on what arrangements will be in Northern Ireland's best interests.

For many, the advert's release marks the countdown to Christmas.
For others, it signals the start of a commercial battle to release the most sentimental and memorable campaign in the hope it will translate into profit.
Adverts from stores like Waitrose, Asda and Aldi are all set to follow, in the meantime let's find out all you need to know about the penguin who's been trending globally across Twitter.
1. Monty is an Adélie penguin which can be found along the Antarctic coast. They are tough, old birds who breed further south than any other penguin. Brrr!
2. Newly-engaged Benedict Cumberbatch is reportedly gutted* at Monty's fame because he struggles to say the word "penguin".
3. The crux of Monty's story is that he is longing for a mate. A chick to call his own. Don't worry Monty, those urges you are feeling are totally natural. When male and female penguins hook up they become inseparable. They even take it in turns to look after their chicks while their partner is out at sea.
4. As the autumn leaves start to fall and seasons start to change, Monty begins searching for his future wife. This is not surprising as Adélie penguins head to breeding grounds at that time of year.
5. Don't let Monty's cute complexion fool you, he can have a sneaky, mean side. During breeding period, Adélie penguins switch from a calm nature to aggressive. Some have even been filmed stealing rocks from their neighbours' nests.
6. Once Christmas is out of the way and Monty's fame has died down, he may decide to ditch his owner, Sam, for a few days and head to a festival, like Glastonbury or Leeds. A BBC crew which has observed his fellow Adélie penguins reckon he would fit right in because they like to build their nests just out of "pecking distance" of their neighbours, like tents at a festival.

But the Cardiff-based society - the largest in Wales - said it had helped 3,500 first-time buyers onto the housing ladder, up by 1,200 on the previous year.
It also warned 67 workers at its Nemo secured loans business that they were at risk of redundancy.
It has been trying to offload Nemo and said it would no longer take on any new customers.
However, the building society said it believed it could find jobs for many of the staff within its 1,000 strong workforce.
Meanwhile, Principality, which is the sixth biggest society UK-wide, said mortgage lending to home-buyers had passed the £5bn mark for the first time.
Graeme Yorston, group chief executive, said it had been "another strong 12 months".
He said the society would continue to respond to technological demands, which have included rolling out mortgage interviews on Skype and online appointment booking.
Underlying profit was £57.8m, up from £51.9m.
This included dealing with one-off issues like stopping new lending from its subsidiary Nemo, which provides secure loans on properties.
There has been speculation over recent years that Principality would look to sell this part of its business.
It will continue to manage accounts it currently has.
Mr Yorston said although Nemo had made a £14m profit, it did not want to "increase our participation in this market".
Looking ahead at economic prospects, he said he did not expect to see any rise in the official Bank of England base rate until 2017 and "when it does it is likely to be modest".

===Input Doc/Src: Scottish Chambers of Commerce (SCC) chief executive Liz Cameron highlighted the need for 11,000 new roles each year in Scotland's digital and IT sector.
She warned that the vacancies could not be filled entirely by British workers.
Ms Cameron also called for a migration system that responded to Scotland's lower population growth rate.
She said Scotland's projected population growth to 2024 was only 3.1%, compared with a projected 7.5% increase for England over the same period.
She warned that could leave the economy growing more slowly and unable to sustain public service levels.
Ms Cameron's comments came as the prime minister prepares to get Brexit negotiations under way.
Theresa May has set a deadline of 31 March for invoking Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, getting official talks with the EU started.
In a statement, Ms Cameron said: "It is time to make the case for a new migration system that works for the UK, works for Scotland and, above all, works for business.
"Free movement of people across Europe may have led us to become complacent about the effort that is required to target the talents that our businesses need across all sectors and all parts of the UK.
"We need to plan now for a system that will be focused on sourcing the right talent, wherever in the world that exists, and in the numbers that meet the demands of our economy."
Giving greater control over immigration to Holyrood has been a key demand of Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in the wake of the Brexit vote.
However in January the home secretary appeared to rule out the possibility of Scotland being handed powers over immigration after the UK leaves the EU.
Amber Rudd said introducing different rules "would complicate the immigration system, harming its integrity" and cause problems for businesses.

But Mr MacNeil, an MP for the SNP, said the government needed to urgently rethink its support for the proposal.

"The Chinese are involved, the French involved, the UK are involved. They need to take a step back because other places have decided not to go ahead with this stuff."
In his letter to EDF staff, Mr Levy said: "We are currently negotiating with the French state to obtain commitments allowing us to secure our financial position.
"I am sure that this project is a good project for the group and that in the near future, all the conditions will come together for it to be definitely launched.
"It is clear that I will not engage EDF in this project before these conditions are met."
The company, which is 85% owned by the French government and owns 58 reactors in France, is expected to finalise in April how it will fund the project.
It has postponed the decision a number of times. The plan was delayed in January, reportedly owing to funding difficulties.
But Mr Levy highlighted in his letter that China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN), which will own 33.5% of the project, was investing about 8bn euros (£6bn).
He also expressed his confidence in EDF to manage "very large projects".
Pressure is mounting as the £18bn cost of the Hinkley project is more than the entire value of the firm.
And there is scepticism as the British government has agreed to pay more than twice the current wholesale price of energy once the plant is producing - £92.50 per megawatt hour for electricity, against £37 per m
---Sum/Tgt: Fresh doubts have arisen over plans by French Energy firm EDF to build an £18bn nuclear power plant at Hinkley Point, Somerset.

===Input Doc/Src: Online security specialists Cloudflare said it recorded the "biggest" attack of its kind on Monday.
Hackers used weaknesses in the Network Time Protocol (NTP), a system used to synchronise computer clocks, to flood servers with huge amounts of data.
The technique could potentially be used to force popular services offline.
Several experts had predicted that the NTP would be used for malicious purposes.
The target of this latest onslaught is unknown, but it was directed at servers in Europe, Cloudflare said.
Attackers used a well-known method to bring down a system known as Denial of Service (DoS) - in which huge amounts of data are forced on a target, causing it to fall over.
Cloudflare chief executive Matthew Prince said his firm had measured the "very big" attack at about 400 gigabits per second (Gbps), 100Gbps larger than an attack on anti-spam service Spamhaus last year.
In a report published three months ago, Cloudflare warned that attacks on the NTP were on the horizon and gave details of how web hosts could best try to protect their customers.
NTP servers, of which there are thousands around the world, are designed to keep computers synchronised to the same time.
The fundamentals of the NTP began operating in 1985. While there have been changes to the system since then, it still operates in much the same way.
A computer needing to synchronise time with the NTP will send a small amount of data to make the request. The NTP will then reply by sending data back.
The vulnerability lies with two weaknesses. Firstly, the amount of data the NTP sends back is bigger than the amount it receives, meaning an attack is instantly amplified.
Secondly, the original computer's location can be "spoofed", tricking the NTP into sending the information back to somewhere else.
In this attack, it is likely that many machines were used to make requests to the NTP. Hackers spoofed their location so that the massive amounts of data from the NTP were diverted to a single target.
"Ampli
---Sum/Tgt: A massive attack that exploited a key vulnerability in the infrastructure of the internet is the "start of ugly things to come", it has been warned.

===Input Doc/Src: Members of the RMT and TSSA unions backed industrial action following a similar vote by drivers.
Workers in these unions will now join a planned 24-hour walkout by members of the drivers' union Aslef, which begins at 21:30 BST on 8 July.
Talks aimed at averting a strike are being held at the conciliation service Acas.
The RMT union and TSSA said its workers planned to begin striking at 18:30 BST.
The unions are in dispute with London Underground over pay and conditions for the new all-night Tube, which is due to start at weekends from mid-September, on sections of the Central, Jubilee, Northern, Piccadilly and Victoria lines.
The RMT said its members voted by 91% in favour of strikes and 96% for other forms of industrial action.
The union is also in dispute over a series of other issues including jobs and safety.
RMT General Secretary Mick Cash said: "The industrial relations situation on the Tube has sunk to an almost unprecedented low with all four unions united and balloting for action over pay and working arrangements due to be ushered in under the guise of the mayor's 'night Tube' vanity project in just 10 weeks' time."
TSSA General Secretary Manuel Cortes said: "We hope that this result will show Boris Johnson just how angry our members are at his plans to try and rush the start of the night Tube without any detailed agreement on manning levels."
Among TSSA members, the vote in support of strikes was 76%, with 88% backing other forms of action in a turnout of 44%.
London Underground's chief operating officer Steve Griffiths said: "Londoners and businesses overwhelmingly back the Night Tube.
"It will make life easier for everyone, cut journey times, create jobs and boost the economy.
"No-one is being asked to work more hours," he added. "In return, we are offering a realistic pay increase this year and next, as well as an additional payment for Night Tube working. "
---Sum/Tgt: More London Underground workers have voted to strike in a dispute over the new all-night Tube service.

===Input Doc/Src: The terror attacks that traumatised this small nation have dominated political life and the media in Norway ever since.
Norwegians are weary of the wall-to-wall media coverage of the Breivik attacks but they are still searching for answers about what happened that day. In particular, the victims' families want to know why it took police so long to respond.
The former justice minister Knut Storberget and the former chief of security services (PST) Janne Kristiansen, both in charge at the time, were forced to resign under heavy criticism of the handling of the terror attacks.
After months of criticism, the police, the PST and Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg finally apologised in March.
The catalogue of police errors on the day is currently under investigation and will be a main subject of the independent public inquiry into the attacks which is due to be published in August.
Oslo District Court has built a new, custom-made courtroom (no 250) for Breivik's trial, and refurbished two floors to accommodate the media and the many aggrieved parties who will be following the trial. Geir Engebretsen, president of the court, says the trial is estimated to cost around Â£10m (12.1m euros; $15.9m).
He expects there to be between 1,000-1,400 people in the court building every day during the trial, however there are only 190 places available in the main courtroom which are reserved for the victims and members of the press.
An estimated 2,500 people will be able to follow the trial via video link in 18 local courts around the country.
The police have the responsibility of securing the building and have promised that everyone will feel safe. Breivik himself will be protected in court by a bulletproof screen. He has received at least two confirmed death threats in prison.
The case will be heard by a panel of five judges rather than a jury: two professional judges and three lay judges who are general members of the public.
The accused: Anders Behring Breivik (33)
Judges: Wenche Elizab
---Sum/Tgt: Preparations for the trial of Anders Behring Breivik have been going on since his dramatic arrest on the island of Utoeya on 22 July last year.

===Input Doc/Src: After defeats in their past two League One games, Phil Brown's side took an early lead from the penalty spot when Simon Cox fired home.
Southend remain one spot and one point outside the play-off places after sixth-placed Millwall overcame Northampton, while defeat leaves Chesterfield nine points from safety with thee games remaining.
Anthony Wordsworth and Cox breached the static Spireites defence in the second half to kill the contest, while Marc-Antoine Fortune made it four with his first touch after coming off the bench.
Just before the break Dion Donohue was dismissed for a foul on Jason Demetriou to add to Chesterfield's woes.
Cox was the man that earned and scored Southend's 15th-minute penalty. On the ball, he stood firm as goalkeeper Thorsten Stuckmann scampered towards him and when contact was made the referee had an easy decision to make and the spot-kick was duly converted.
Poor defending contributed to United's three second-half goals, Wordsworth converting a Demetriou cross while Cox took advantage of some solid Will Atkinson work before Fortune slipped through a shell-shocked defence to complete the scoring.

===Input Doc/Src: The alcohol is flowing, the skirts short: this is the epitome of Turkey's most liberal, Westernised city - and my first stop as I travel across the country ahead of Turkey's upcoming election.
"You have pepper spray, you have tear gasâ€¦but we're still freeâ€¦this country is ours," the fans sing.
On the stage at Izmir's seafront is Duman, one of Turkey's best-loved rock bands. As they belt out tunes about the anti-government protests of 2013, the thousands-strong crowd goes wild.
"When I was studying in Poland, people there thought Turkey is a heavily Muslim country; that the women are all covered and men have four wives," laughs Serbay Kos, a volleyball trainer.
"But Izmir isn't like that - we're like Europe and America."
He takes a swig of beer as the song changes.
"I'm worried that this government is trying to make Turkey into a more Muslim country, like Iraq or Syria - but we want to be free."
It is a sentiment you hear frequently in this relaxed, coastal city - Turkey's third largest.
Izmir has always looked across the Aegean to Europe; its Greek heritage and affluent bon-viveur feel shaping its politics.
The centre-left Republican People's Party, or CHP, has its stronghold here - Izmir is known as the "CHP's castle".
Staunchly secular, it is the party of modern Turkey's founding father, Kemal Ataturk.
In the last election, the CHP took 44% of the vote in Izmir - more than double its national share. And it is aiming higher for the poll on 7 June.
Many here fear the growing conservatism of the current government.
Under the 12-year rule of the Islamist-rooted AK Party, constitutionally-secular Turkey has fundamentally changed.
There is now a push to raise a "pious generation" - in the words of Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan - and CHP-dominated Izmir appears increasingly isolated.
But in the Bostanli market of Izmir, local CHP candidate Zeynep Altiok is full of confidence.

Wojciech Szczesny stopped Jermain Defoe's deflected shot as Arsenal moved fourth in the Premier League table.
Media playback is not supported on this device
There was one worry for Arsenal fans as midfielder Jack Wilshere came off before half-time but Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger said afterwards it was illness rather than injury that prompted the 21-year-old's withdrawal.
That will potentially be a relief to England boss Roy Hodgson, who has two upcoming World Cup qualifiers, starting on Friday.
This absorbing encounter lacked the high-scoring of the 5-2 victories the Gunners have enjoyed over Spurs for the last two seasons. But a fourth consecutive win since they lost to Aston Villa on the opening day was a perfect response from the Gunners to taunts about Arsene Wenger's lack of spending compared with Spurs manager Andre Villas-Boas.
Tottenham have only won once at Arsenal since 1993 and, despite creating several good openings, it was Arsenal who enjoyed the more clear-cut opportunities, Santi Cazorla twice showing his invention from clever free-kicks early on.
Villas-Boas has spent close to £105m on new players this summer but while his side look powerful, they were often lacking the speed of an Arsenal team with more Premier League experience - and it was an illustration of what they might miss without Gareth Bale, who has completed his move to Real Madrid.
There have been 125 goals scored in Premier League meetings between Tottenham and Arsenal, more than any other fixture.
The first-half goal that won the game was a case in point as the ball was swept out to Walcott on the right, the Tottenham defence misjudging their attempt to move up and catch the Gunners attack offside, and the England winger crossed low for the darting Giroud to poke in at 
---Sum/Tgt: Arsenal continued their fine home record against Tottenham by handing their north London rivals a first defeat of the season.

"I'm just saying here's the information that I've gathered.
"I've put it into five minutes, and I want you to take that information and go and research yourself."
Swiss, who is best known for being part of So Solid Crew, added: "Gather the information and then make a decision on what you want to do with it."
Before the show, Radio 1Xtra explained to Newsbeat that: "The track, which tackles the complex issues around the word, will be played in the late-night specialist show with full warnings ahead of its play and an appropriate introduction giving context to the song.
"The decision to play the track is based on musical merit and it is in line with audience expectations."
Before playing the five-minute track in full during his 22:00 - 01:00 show, Semtex reflected the mixed response the track has had online.
He said: "In case you haven't heard it this is a track that stopped the internet this week.

"It stopped everybody to put down what they were doing and think about what this guy was saying on the track.
"Some people got offended, some people were like 'I'm glad somebody said that', other people were educated."
The track opens with a series of samples referencing black slavery, including quotes from Django Unchained and references several cases of when the media has reported the term being used in a negative way.
A sequence of lyrics, which ends with the song's title, reiterate the point Swiss made during the interview.
"It can be a term of endearment or an emotional trigger.

===Input Doc/Src: It warns about what it calls "medium-term" dangers in both emerging and developed economies, in its twice-yearly report.
It expresses particular concerns about Europe, Japan and China.
On a more positive note, the fund does say that short-term risks have abated since its previous assessment of global financial stability in April.
Pressures on emerging markets have eased, the report says. Rising commodity prices (though they are still relatively low) have helped and so has the reduced uncertainty about China's prospects in the near term.
The report says investors were taken by surprise by the result of the British referendum on the European Union, but the political shock was absorbed by markets. They passed what it calls "this severe stress test".
But looking further ahead, the IMF sees growing risks.  A key factor is bank profits.
The good news is that banks are in some respects stronger than they were before the financial crisis. They have more capital, a kind of financial buffer that enables them to survive losses. Their liquidity has improved, which means they have more chance of coping if they suddenly have to find funds quickly.
But they are struggling to make money.
Weak profitability makes it harder for them to build up their capital (which they can do by holding on to some profit rather than giving it all to shareholders as dividends). It also makes it harder for them to expand lending to business and consumers, as is needed to support economic recovery.
The problems partly reflect the very low interest rate environment that developed-country banks have to operate in. The struggle to make profits also reflects the persistent economic weakness in the developed world, which means weaker demand for credit.
Some banks in the eurozone have a burden of problem loans, which are not being repaid and that they have still not dealt with.

===Input Doc/Src: One of Afghanistan's largest cities, it has long been a strategically important transport hub for the north of the country.
Kunduz is linked by highways to Kabul in the south, with Mazar-e-Sharif in the west and with Tajikistan in the north.
But it has always held symbolic significance for the Taliban because it was a key northern stronghold before 2001.
Kunduz is considered a gateway to Afghanistan's northern provinces and shares a border with Tajikistan, Afghanistan's Central Asian neighbour.
The border with Tajikistan is porous, and it is used for the smuggling of Afghan opium and heroin to Central Asia, which finally finds its way to Europe.
Any side controlling Kunduz would not only influence the surrounding areas, but could also control one of the most important drug smuggling routes in the region.
Security for the region - which was a flagship project for the German army - was transferred to Afghan forces in 2013.
But Kunduz has many other problems: bad governance as well as incompetence and intimidation by some local officials have alienated many in the province.
It has long been at the frontline of a determined campaign by the Taliban to reclaim it. In May last year the BBC's David Loyn reported from there as fighting between government forces and the Taliban unfolded.
The Taliban already control huge chunks of the province's rural areas, where the majority of the population lives. The insurgents have intensified their fighting in the province over the past two years.
A BBC reporter visited the city after it was back in government hands following its September 2015 capture. He found shock, a jail emptied of prisoners and many residents fearful of a Taliban return.
The battle for the city saw one of the worst incidents in the recent Afghan war when a Medecins sans Frontieres hospital was hit by a US air strike.
The city is  estimated to have about 300,000 residents but those numbers are likely to be fluid because fighting has prompted many to flee the city.

---Sum/Tgt: The brief militant seizure of Kunduz in 2015 was one of the Afghan government's worst setbacks since Taliban forces were ousted in 2001.

===Input Doc/Src: Eight former officers are suing South Wales Police after being cleared of charges relating to the investigation of Lynette White's murder in 1988.
The corruption trial collapsed in 2011.
A hearing in Cardiff was told there was "no intention" to uncover the truth behind the wrongful conviction of the Cardiff Three.
Former officers Graham Mouncher, Thomas Page, Richard Powell, John Seaford, Michael Daniels, Peter Greenwood, Paul Jennings and Paul Stephen are suing the force for misfeasance in public office, false imprisonment and trespass.
Leslie Thomas QC said allegations of pressurising a witness into giving a false statement against Mr Page were "easily rubbished".
He said one witness voluntarily accompanied Mr Page to the police station and had made no allegation of ill treatment "or anything improper".
Cardiff's Civil Justice Centre was told officers investigating allegations of corruption misidentified Mr Page as someone intimidating a witness in an interview, but he "simply wasn't there".
On Monday, the court heard that murderer Jeffrey Gafoor may not have acted alone when he killed Ms White in a flat in Cardiff's docklands on Valentine's Day.
Tony Parris, Stephen Miller and Yusef Abdullahi - who became known as the Cardiff Three - were wrongly jailed for life in 1990 for the murder and freed in 1992 after their convictions were quashed.

The Holyland is a residential part of south Belfast popular with students.
Employment and Learning Minister Stephen Farry is to meet residents' representatives on Monday afternoon.
Eleven people were arrested in the area and the city centre over the St Patrick's Day period. One policeman was injured when bottles were thrown at officers in Agincourt Avenue.
A number of vehicles were also damaged and residents complained about excessive noise and litter in their streets.
There has been a history of trouble in the Holyland on previous St Patrick's Days and talks have been held before in a bid to prevent students engaging in anti-social behaviour.
The chairman of the Holyland Regeneration Association, Ray Farley, said the existing measures had not worked and called for Stormont ministers to intervene.
Speaking last Friday ahead of the meeting, Mr Farry said he was "appalled" by the behaviour of some young people in the area but said the majority of them were not university or college students.
However, he added that further steps to address students' bad behaviour would now be considered in light of this year's trouble.

===Input Doc/Src: Shaker Aamer was held at the US military base in Cuba over allegations he had led a Taliban unit and had met Osama Bin Laden, but was never charged.
Downing Street said there were "no plans" to detain him after his arrival.
Mr Aamer said he felt "obliged" to everyone who fought for him to be released, and to "bring an end to Guantanamo".
"My thanks go to Allah first, second to my wife, my family, to my kids and then to my lawyers who did everything they could to carry the word to the world," he said.
"I am overwhelmed by what people have done by their actions, their thoughts and their prayers, and without their devotion to justice I would not be here in Britain now."
Concern has been raised over the health of the Saudi national, 48, whose family live in London, and the BBC witnessed an ambulance arrive at the airport.
Number 10 said Prime Minister David Cameron "welcomes" the release of Mr Aamer, who has permission to live in the UK indefinitely because his wife is British.
It also said any necessary security measures "will be put in place".
The father-of-four landed at London's Biggin Hill Airport shortly before 13:00 GMT.
Mr Aamer's father-in-law, Saeed Siddique, said his release was a "miracle".
"It's a delightful day," he told BBC News while admitting it was also a "surprise".
Mr Aamer, who was first held by US authorities in Afghanistan in 2001, maintains he was in the country doing charity work.
Since 2007 Mr Aamer, who claims he was tortured, has been cleared for release twice, by US presidents George W Bush and then Barack Obama.
It is understood Mr Aamer will go through standard immigration checks now he has arrived in the UK.
Mr Aamer's legal representative Clive Stafford Smith told BBC News: "Shaker only wants the truth to come out he is not interested in persecuting anyone.

===Input Doc/Src: One migrant, who said he had spent £15,000 so far on trying to reach the UK from Syria, also said many of the criminals were British nationals.
The BBC saw cars with UK number plates at a camp on Dunkirk's outskirts.
The mayor of nearby Teteghem, Franck Dhersin, said UK-registered cars - driven by what he called English mafia - were often spotted there.
He said people in the UK who complained about migrants trying to reach the country did not realise "the cars are English and the owners are English".
The tactics of migrants around Dunkirk are different from those in Calais, where hundreds try to board lorries and scale fences every night to gain entry to the Channel Tunnel.
The Dunkirk migrants are driven to locations where they can try to stow away on lorries.
The Syrian migrant who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity said the £15,000 he had paid traffickers was all of his money.
He has spent £12,000 on getting from Syria to France and a further £3,000 on trying to cross the Channel.
He said migrants were threatened by traffickers if they did not follow orders.
"I'm so, so scared," he said.
"They have guns. They put it to someone's head and said 'You move again and I will kill you'."
It's a similar story at the Teteghem camp a few miles away.
Mr Dhersin said the traffickers were "very violent" and "just want to make money with immigrants".
He said British traffickers had been operating in the area for several years, but were now much more organised.
Until Tuesday he had insisted on visiting the Teteghem camp despite the dangers.
"I wanted to show that a French mayor can go where he wants," he said.
"I said 'I will enter and if you don't want [me to], I will come back with a policeman'."
But Mr Dhersin said that a man there had shown him a gun and threatened to rape a reporter he was with.
Police have advised him not to return.

===Input Doc/Src: The Health Protection Agency (HPA) report said a hot tub on show at JTF Warehouse in Stoke-on-Trent was the probable source of an outbreak in 2012.
Richard Griffin, 64, and 79-year old William Hammersley, both died and 19 other people caught the disease.
The HPA said hot tubs posed a health risk if not regularly maintained.
BBC News has not been able to contact JTF Warehouse for a comment following the HPA report.
The report said: "This was a significant outbreak and has raised questions on the acceptability of operating spa pools (also known as whirl pools and hot tubs) in public places where the general population has access.
"Spa Pools are known to pose a risk of Legionella if water systems are not rigorously maintained, properly managed and subject to regular chemical controls.
"Operating spa pools on display in indoor spaces, even if not used for bathing, have been previously shown to be the cause of outbreaks in other countries," the report added.
Lawyers Irwin Mitchell are taking legal action on behalf of the families of two men who died, as well as 16 other people who caught the disease.
They are calling for a public inquiry into the outbreak.
Clive Garner from the firm said: "We hope that now this report has been published those responsible for the store will admit liability for the illness suffered by our clients so that we can help them to access the exact level of care and support they now need.

===Input Doc/Src: He was speaking in the first leaders' debate of the Irish general election.
He was responding to Fianna Fáil's Micheál Martin who said he would not form a coalition with Sinn Féin as he does not trust them on security.
He said: "Politicians here could learn a lesson from the unionists, who have more reason to distrust Sinn Féin."
Mr Adams referred to past and present leaders of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), who have led a power-sharing government with Sinn Féin in Northern Ireland since 2007.
"Ian Paisley can go into government with Martin McGuinness, and Peter Robinson can go into government, and Arlene Foster can go into government with Martin McGuinness," Mr Adams said.
The Sinn Féin leader was challenged by one of the debate moderators, Pat Kenny, that the D'Hondt system forces the parties in Northern Ireland together.
The D'Hondt system is a type of proportional representation used to allocate seats and ministerial posts.
Mr Adams said it was the citizens of Northern Ireland make the decisions about who goes into government by them giving a mandate.
Taoiseach Enda Kenny was asked whether the bookmakers' predicted outcome, a Fine Gael/Fianna Fáil coalition, was the most likely outcome.
He replied that voters have a choice between "the party that wrecked the country, or two parties with different perspectives who have worked together to set the country on the path to recovery". He said Fine Gael/Labour will provide stability.
When the debate moved to the Irish economy, Labour leader Joan Burton accused Sinn Féin of "fuzzy economics" which would kill jobs.
The Irish deputy prime minister said she is mystified by Sinn Féin's plans to cut the Universal Social Charge (USC), claiming it would reduce tax only for people earning less than €20,000 (£15,515).
USC is a tax that was introduced in December 2010 as a temporary measure by the late finance minister, Brian Lenihan.
It was applicable to all gross incomes over €4,004 (£3,106)

John Anderson top-scored with 59 while Ed Joyce (37), William Porterfield (29) and Gary Wilson (25) also contributed on a day when 45 overs were lost.
Tanveer Ahmed and Tanwir Afzal each picked up two wickets for the tourists.
The Irish play positively, scoring at a rate of around four an over in an attempt to force a result despite the best efforts of the Belfast weather.
Joyce scored a fluent 37 from 55 balls in an opening stand of 53 with skipper Porterfield and was unluckily dismissed when he hit his wicket.
Anderson and Porterfield added a further 48 before the captain was bowled.
Niall O'Brien (15) and Paul Stirling (six) both went cheaply, but Anderson's fourth half-century for Ireland ensured they were always on top.
The Merrion man top-scored before mistiming an attempted hook shot.
Gary Wilson scored a breezy 25 and was trapped lbw two balls before the umpires decided that the light was too poor to continue.
Porterfield indicated that Ireland would bat on Friday, probably hoping to set Hong Kong a target of around 330.

===Input Doc/Src: The 72-year-old from Ramsgate, Kent, is one of seven people to have been charged with the importation offence, which has been deemed a "relatively new phenomenon" by the National Crime Agency.
But what is the scale of the problem?
More than 100 child sex dolls have been seized in the UK as part of a special operation set up by the National Crime Agency (NCA) and Border Force.
Investigators believe the dolls, which are made to be as life-like as possible, are being imported by people who have a "sexual interest" in children.
Advertised as "adult dolls" on sites including EBay and Amazon, they are manufactured in the Far East and sent to Britain via courier, fast parcel and other delivery services.
Each doll costs around Â£800, is made of a silicon-like material and weighs as much as a child.
The NCA, which set up Operation Shiraz, says paediatricians have assessed the dolls seized to be "anatomically correct".
Since March 2016, 123 dolls have been seized, destined for 120 importers.
Seven people have been charged with importation offences, two of whom, Andrew Dobson and Dean Hall, have been convicted and sentenced.
Dobson, 49 and from Crewe, was jailed for two years and eight months. He also admitted possessing indecent images of children.
Hall, 42, from Bury St Edmunds, was given a two-year suspended term. He was in also in possession of indecent images.
Hazel Stewart, operations manager for the NCA, said: "The individuals who import this type of article - child sex dolls - have a sexual interest in children and these items are an indication of that."
She said when people have been questioned by police about the dolls some have claimed they were bought for a "joke", others say they for "companionship".
"If it was a Marks and Spencer mannequin I wouldn't be stood here," she said.
Each doll is typically packed in a brown cardboard box.  It is unclothed and the head is detached from the body with the feet and hands packaged to avoid damage.

===Input Doc/Src: Leaked documents show that Sigmundur Gunnlaugsson and his wife bought offshore company Wintris in 2007.
He did not declare an interest in the company when entering parliament in 2009. He sold his 50% of Wintris to his wife for $1 (70p), eight months later.
He says no rules were broken and his wife did not benefit financially.
The offshore company was used to invest millions of dollars of inherited money, according to a document signed by Mr Gunnlaugsson's wife Anna Sigurlaug Palsdottir in 2015.
The leaked documents show that Mr Gunnlaugsson was granted a general power of attorney over Wintris - which gave him the power to manage the company "without any limitation". Ms Palsdottir had a similar power of attorney.
Court records show that Wintris had significant investments in the bonds of three major Icelandic banks that collapsed during the financial crisis which began in 2008. Wintris is listed as a creditor with millions of dollars in claims in the banks' bankruptcies.
Mr Gunnlaugsson became prime minister in 2013 and has been involved in negotiations about the banks which could affect the value of the bonds held by Wintris.
He resisted pressure from foreign creditors - including many UK customers - to repay their deposits in full.
If foreign investors had been repaid, it may have adversely affected both the Icelandic banks and the value of the bonds held by Wintris.
But Mr Gunnlaugsson kept his wife's interest in the outcome a secret.
Mr Gunnlaugsson's spokesman said his policies had put the interests of the Icelandic people ahead of the interests of the failed banks' claimants.
"The prime minister's wife's losses on these bonds issued by the failed banks will amount to hundreds of millions of Kronur and the scope for recoveries is extremely small."
The spokesman said Ms Palsdottir had always declared the assets to the tax authorities and that under the parliamentary rules Mr Gunnlaugsson did not have to declare an interest in Wintris.

Robertson said he had played some of his best snooker leading up to his Crucible defeat, which he put down to a run of misfortune.
"I said coming into the World Championship that it's probably the best season I've had to date," the 2010 world champion said.
"I've played really well, but snooker's a funny game. It's very frustrating when you don't always get the right kind of rub - you watch tennis and know if you play better than the other guy, you win.
"But that's the game we play. It can create mini-upsets. I suppose if it was the top four players in the world getting to the semis, it'd be pretty boring."
Robertson continued: "Michael played a great match - nothing really went right for me.

===Input Doc/Src: Pete Cresswell was forced to leave Liverpool University without graduating for protesting against its investments in apartheid-era South Africa.
The student was one of 10, including Channel 4 News presenter Jon Snow, punished for a six-week sit-in at the university's Senate House.
Mr Cresswell said he was "gobsmacked".
"If I went back through it 1,000 times, my 22-year-old self in 1970 would do it again," said Mr Cresswell, who was the only one of the 10 to be expelled.
The former politics student said he was "astonished" to be awarded a degree and had always thought "hell would freeze over" before the university gave him one.
Awarding him an honorary Bachelor of Arts degree at Liverpool Philharmonic Hall, vice chancellor Prof Janet Beer said "we in the university want to put this right".
She said that while the university "cannot undo" Mr Cresswell's "unfair and wrong" treatment, it can "recognise that wrong, and publicly do so" to a man who "saw what was the right thing to do and paid a price for it".
Inspired by the 1968 student revolts in France, activists across the UK brought protests and sit-ins to universities into the early 1970s and students in Liverpool were no exception.
The chancellor of the university at the time was Lord Salisbury, a known supporter of apartheid.
Mr Cresswell said: "Looking back, I think we were right and if you look at the issues, we have been proved right.
"This does put a full stop on the whole thing and I just feel pleased that a bit of history has been reviewed and put to bed."
The Birmingham-born student stayed in Liverpool and despite having to leave his politics course during his third year with a "CV from hell", eventually became a social worker, holding roles with the council and the Care Quality Commission.
Now retired, Mr Cresswell said he was pleased his daughter had had the chance to see him in robes - she graduated herself more than 10 years before him.

===Input Doc/Src: Ex-Wales striker John Hartson is concerned that the risk of injury is too great with the tournament less than a week away.
Coleman's team start their Euro 2016 campaign against Slovakia six days after their Stockholm visit, and already have several injury concerns.
"I don't think he'll take many chances with his big players," Hartson said.
"Chris has to be slightly cautious because there's only six days after Sunday until Wales open against Slovakia."
Hartson, who scored 14 goals in 51 Wales appearances, thinks that short turnaround could lead to Coleman resting Real Madrid forward Gareth Bale among others.
The world's most expensive player was last in action when he helped club side Real Madrid to win their 11th Champions League title.
"He might not play the likes of Bale, Aaron Ramsey, Joe Allen and Ashley Williams," added Hartson.
"Bale might have 10-15 minutes to shake off the cobwebs near the end maybe. I just don't think we can risk him.
"It's very close, but I don't think we can risk our big players."
Bale joined up with the Wales squad this week after his Champions League involvement.
After playing Slovakia, Wales face England in Lens on 16 June and Russia in Toulouse on 20 June.
Coleman's team is the first from Wales to qualify for the finals of a major international tournament since the 1958 World Cup.
The manager has already selected Crystal Palace's Joe Ledley who broke a bone in a leg less than a month ago.
Joe Allen and Hal Robson-Kanu are also likely to miss the Sweden clash.
"Chris has to be careful with injuries," added Hartson.
"The last thing he wants is any more injuries to deal with. He needs to make sure everyone is fit and well to play that first game in France."

===Input Doc/Src: About 20 people are currently living in the former car showroom on Iffley Road after moving in on New Year's Eve.
Leaseholder Midcounties Co-operative has said the squatters can stay until April, despite a judge granting it permission to evict them earlier.
But owner Oxford University's Wadham College said it requires the building back by 27 February.
This is so preparations for demolition can begin, the college said, as it intends to use the site for student housing.
Neo, a spokesman for the Iffley Open House campaign group, said it was "unacceptable" for the college to try to get the squatters out by February.
He added: "The weather will still be cold, I don't want people out on the streets."
The campaigners have asked that the building, which has been empty for two years, be officially designated as homeless housing.
Kevin Brown, group general manager at the Midcounties Co-operative, said in April the company has a legal obligation to hand the site back to Wadham College.
He added: "To ensure we're able to meet that requirement, we have been granted a repossession order but our preference is not to have to use it."
A Wadham College spokesperson said: "Whilst we have deep sympathy with the plight of homeless people, any solution must not delay the redevelopment of the building as homes for students.
"We will continue our discussions with all parties in the hope of resolving this amicably and are seeking help from local homeless support groups and charities to help find longer-term accommodation for these homeless people."

===Input Doc/Src: Scientists using Europe's Cryosat radar spacecraft are now routinely mapping variations in height on a fine scale, both in time and in area.
The UK-led team's analysis shows that Greenland is shedding ice to the ocean.
Their preliminary assessment is very close to that produced from gravity satellites, which currently see losses of over 250bn tonnes of ice each year.
But while the headline numbers may be similar, Cryosat brings important additional detail to the picture.
It allows the team to study changes across the entire ice sheet at fine resolution, meaning the scientists are able to monitor the behaviour of individual glaciers.
Cryosat is also helping them to track seasonal variations in the elevation of the ice sheet, which will permit the researchers to investigate how the ice sheet changes from year to year.
"These results allow us to identify key glaciers which, in the last few years, are showing signs of rapid change," said Dr Malcolm McMillan from the NERC Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling (CPOM) at Leeds University.
The new study updates a previous assessment by the Alfred Wegener Institute, and complements existing measurements made by the US space agency's GRACE gravity satellites. These are spacecraft that can essentially "weigh" the ice sheet from orbit.
Dr McMillan and colleagues are presenting their work this week in San Francisco at the Fall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union, the largest annual gathering of Earth scientists.
Researchers have previously used space- and plane-borne laser altimeters to produce the kind of maps now coming from Cryosat.
But their data was often very sparse, making it difficult to achieve a comprehensive and up-to-date picture.
The earlier radar missions, too, struggled to get to grips with Greenland.
In part, this was because their measurement footprints were too large to really see even the biggest glaciers, but also because they were sometimes frustrated by surface conditions.

===Input Doc/Src: The Staffordshire Regiment Association said it paid Â£64,000 to buy a 10-year lease on The King's Head in Lichfield.
The regiment was founded in 1705 when Col Luke Lillingston raised a force that later became the Staffords.
Capt Dave Donnelly said: "It's brilliant. We believe we have bought a piece of history."
He said the purchase was prompted by a "mad idea" by ex-warrant officer Derek Watts, from Wolverhampton, who went on social media to drum up support.
Within a fortnight, he had managed to raise enough pledges to buy the pub.
"We have reunions in the pub annually, so we didn't want it becoming a bed and breakfast or anything like that," said Capt Donnelly.
"The support to get this off the ground has been immense. We don't know how many associations run pubs, but what is unique is that we were actually founded there."
The pub will reopen - following a refurbishment - on March 25, 312 years to the day from when the regiment was formed.
It will serve two ales created in honour of the regiment - one named Col Lillingston and the other named Watchman, after the association's mascot - and will be managed by a former regiment man.
It will be opened by Lichfield's Lord Mayor and a descendent of Col Lillingston. The association will march from Lichfield Cathedral to the pub and will play the Last Post.

===Input Doc/Src: Henry said the black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) community had "initiative fatigue".
"Tony Hall's announcement last week is something but with massive respect it's on an old model that doesn't work," he added.
The BBC wants to increase BAME on-air talent to one in six people by 2017.
Speaking at a culture, media and sport select committee hearing, Henry said there had been "29 initiatives at the BBC in the last 15 years and numbers (of people from BAME backgrounds working in the industry) have gone down".
He added: "Idris Elba and Chiwetel Ejiofor didn't need more training. They just needed a break."
Director general Lord Hall's announcement last Friday also included a series of targets for staff representation off-air and several other initiatives.
In addition to a Â£2.1m development fund, the BBC is bringing together a group of experts, including Henry, Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, Asian Network presenter Nihal and Lady Benjamin, to form an Independent Diversity Action Group, chaired by Lord Hall.
"I think the group will be tough-minded," Lord Hall said on Friday. "But it's good to have people who are there to support you, but also say you can do better here."
Henry was addressing the select committee during its wider review of the future of the BBC ahead of the Charter Renewal in 2016/17.
The actor and comedian wants the broadcasting industry to adopt the plan he launched at Bafta earlier this year to increase BAME representation - dubbed the Henry plan - based on the model that media watchdog Ofcom uses to classify programmes made in the nations and regions.
In response to his comments, a BBC spokesperson said: "Last week we set out far reaching plans that we believe will make a tangible difference - we will work hard to deliver them and of course reserve the option of going further if we fall short, but people should judge us on progress over the coming months and years before concluding the need for even more measures."

===Input Doc/Src: A new study tracked 72 koalas living near six wildlife crossings, specially installed by the Queensland government between 2010 and 2013.
It was the first study to test the effectiveness of the crossings, which were part of a $20 million retrofit project to help stop roadway deaths of the vulnerable marsupial.
"I was really sceptical about whether the animals would use them," says Prof Darryl Jones, a behavioural ecologist at Griffith University in Brisbane who studies the impact of roadways on wildlife.
"I have to admit straight up that I thought koalas were going to be a pretty dumb animal. They spend most of their time stoned on eucalyptus oil."
"But that's not the case. This proves they really can innovate," he says. "No koala has ever walked under a road on a ledge ever before in its evolutionary history, and indeed they were doing it within a couple of months."
"They were able to learn new tricks far faster than anyone would have thought."
The study, published in the journal Wildlife Research, used multiple technologies to track individual koalas, including cameras, GPS collars and newly-developed wireless identification chips, which communicated with devices at the entrance and exit of each crossing.
"This is going to be very influential in terms of showing accurately and reliably that the animals do use these structures," Prof Jones says.
Crossings and wildlife-proof fences were installed at hotspots where there had been continuous incidents of koalas being struck by vehicles.
While roadways still pose a threat to koalas, Prof Jones says road deaths have "almost vanished" at sites where the crossings have been installed.
Koalas are listed as vulnerable in Queensland, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, and are protected under national environment law.
In 2010, the Queensland government released a Koala Population Report, which showed there had been a 68% reduction in the local population of koalas near Brisbane over 10 years.

===Input Doc/Src: Throughout Northern Ireland's Troubles, hijackings by paramilitaries became an all too frequent occurrence for bus drivers and their passengers.
Ulsterbus, which celebrated its 50th birthday this week, had 1,500 buses destroyed during the Troubles.
However, the impact on drivers was even more severe - 12 lost their lives and many more were injured.
Ulsterbus driver Raymond Bell was hijacked five times, with three of his buses completely destroyed.
"Normally, what they did was to get someone to stand at a pedestrian crossing and as you went down the road they would have stepped onto the crossing to get you stopped," he told BBC NI's Good Morning Ulster.
"Once you stopped, all of a sudden the doors would open and there would be masked men with either cudgels or a gun and they'd say 'we're hijacking your bus'."
Mr Bell said drivers tried not to dwell on the threat because, if they did, they wouldn't have gone into work.
However, he said the incidents did have an effect.
"If you were hijacked and you weren't injured, you came back to the depot and you continued your night's work or your day's work after that," he said.
"Or the company would have said 'we'll cover your duty for you, see you tomorrow if you're able to come in'.
"Quite a lot of drivers suffered mental issues and also injuries and it stayed with them on the job and also many left the job because of issues like that."
The managing director of Ulsterbus during some of the darkest days of the Troubles was former Luftwaffe World War Two conscript Werner Heubeck.
He became famous for carrying bombs off hijacked buses.
Frank Clegg, a former colleague of Mr Heubeck, worked as general manager for services for Ulsterbus.
He said if the company didn't keep the buses running, they weren't serving the people of Northern Ireland.

But the good times did not last long - for neither the company nor the country. A massive corruption scandal last year eroded much of Petrobras's market value.
Brazil's economy too has been on a downward spiral - with high inflation, slow growth and low confidence.
So how did it all go so wrong, so fast?
Petrobras's oil bonanza and Brazil's emerging star status are fairly recent phenomena.
Just a few decades ago, prospects were dire for both.
In the early 1990s, Brazil was a young democracy in deep economic trouble.
Annualised inflation was running close to 5,000%. Decades of protectionism meant there was little competition in most sectors and many national firms had become inefficient.
Petrobras was seen as part of that landscape by many who wanted to privatise it.
One critic used to refer to it as "Petrossauro" - a large, outdated structure that moved slowly and was doomed to extinction in the modern world.
Brazil's fortunes started to change in the mid-1990s - both internally and externally.
Through reforms, successive governments were able to defeat hyperinflation, open up Brazil's economy to the world and redistribute growth, lifting millions out of poverty.
A decade of global economic boom favoured Brazil's champion exports - commodities like coffee, soya, beef and oil.
Brazil's oil sector was opened to foreign companies, but local laws made sure Petrobras kept its role at the top of every major project.
A decade of high international oil prices helped give a great boost to the firm's investment plans.
By 2010 - after all oil dis

===Input Doc/Src: Michael McFeat from Perthshire was expelled by the Kyrgyz authorities after comparing the national dish with the private parts of a horse.
Speaking to the Sunday Post newspaper, Mr McFeat described how he was helped to escape "a lynch mob".
He has now been banned from Kyrgyzstan for five years.
Mr McFeat told the newspaper he actually believed the traditional Kyrgyz dish - chuchuk sausage - was a horse's penis, but the remark on Facebook angered his local colleagues.
He had been working at the Kumtor gold mine, but had to be smuggled away after the incident.
When he arrived at Manas Airport in Bishkek, he was arrested by police under race hatred laws.
Mr McFeat said: "The police told me my act could send Kyrgyzstan to war with the UK."
After appearing in court and making an apology for his remarks, Mr McFeat was put on a flight to Edinburgh.
He added: "I was told there was a 17-page petition demanding I be jailed and the mine went on strike after I left, so they were making an example of me.
"I've always been up for a joke but this was one time I wasn't joking and it's been blown out of proportion."

===Input Doc/Src: But health officials have warned that unless MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccinations continue, a further outbreak cannot be ruled out.
There have been no laboratory-confirmed cases linked to the outbreak area since 22 May, Public Health Wales said.
One person died and a total of 1,219 measles cases were diagnosed during the outbreak since November.
Some 88 people visited a hospital due to the disease while a campaign was launched to boost the uptake of the MMR vaccine.
Dr Marion Lyons, director of health protection for Public Health Wales (PHW), said that the end of the outbreak was in "no small part to unprecedented efforts to vaccinate tens of thousands of people".
"Without so many vaccinations being given, we know that the outbreak could have continued for many more months," said Dr Lyons.
But PHW warned that with 30,000 children in the 10 to 18 years age group still unvaccinated across Wales, there was still a possibility of a further outbreak in the future.
And the health minister urged parents to get their children vaccinated.
Dr Lyons said: "The only reason this outbreak could happen was because not enough young people in Wales were fully vaccinated with two doses of MMR and there is absolutely no guarantee that this could not happen again."
Some 75,868 unscheduled vaccinations were given to people around Wales who had not been immunised in a bid to bring the epidemic under control.
GP surgeries, hospital and schools held drop-in sessions, with PHW particularly keen to target children and young people who may have missed their scheduled jabs.
Health Minister Mark Drakeford said he "wholeheartedly" welcomed the end of the outbreak but insisted there was "still work to do".
"The young people in the 10 to 18 age group who still have not been vaccinated should make the necessary arrangements at their earliest convenience," he added.

===Input Doc/Src: The Labour leader said the "misery" that those travelling to London had faced made a "very good case" for a change of ownership.
Southern passengers have faced delays, cancellations and a reduced timetable amid staff shortages and strikes.
The operator is in a dispute with the RMT union over the role of guards.
Two days of talks aimed at averting a five-day strike by the union are due to begin later at the conciliation service Acas.
Southern has promised to run 60% of its normal timetable if the strike, due to begin on Monday, goes ahead.
The company is also facing fresh strike action after the TSSA union said it would be balloting workers in a dispute over ticket office closures.
"I want to see Southern back in public ownership. I don't believe it's fulfilling its obligations under the franchise it was given, " Mr Corbyn said at a leadership rally in Brighton.
He said that it was a "enormous mistake" not to take all the train operating franchises back into public ownership after the 2001 collapse of the company then running the network, Railtrack, and he re-stated his commitment to renationalise each train service as its contract expires.
At the rally, Mr Corbyn also said the government should have intervened to prevent the financial difficulties at the retailer BHS, which went into administration in April.
Earlier, Mr Corbyn said he was disappointed at an attack on him by David Blanchflower, an economist who has resigned from the committee advising the shadow chancellor John McDonnell.
Mr Blanchflower said Mr Corbyn had no credible economic policy and was more interested in addressing rallies than leading the party to power.
Mr Corbyn said: "I'm disappointed because he was helping us, we were developing and are continuing to develop a very strong and very credible economic policy which is about dealing with inequality in Britain and the need for investment in Britain by the promotion of a National Investment Bank."

===Input Doc/Src: Mosaab, his wife Nada and their three children are getting used to life in Scotland.
They are among hundreds of Syrian people who fled the war and have started new lives with refugee status.
The BBC has agreed not to use their surnames because they fear speaking out may put their family members still in Syria at risk.
Mosaab was a tiler and self-employed lorry driver in Syria. Before the war, he says life was good, living together in peace. They would take trips to the coast and go to the countryside to pick olives straight from the tree.
"I lost friends in the war, our house was destroyed and I was fleeing from place to place looking for a shelter, " he says.

"I and my wife were swapping shifts to take care of my children during the night in case they woke up scared from the sounds of explosions."
The family fled to Lebanon, paying bribes to the border guards. Mosaab hired a car to work as a taxi driver there until they were offered safe passage to Scotland. They are now building new lives for themselves in Clydebank.
I ask him what would have happened if he hadn't fled their home in Homs?
"We would be dead," he replies.
He describes the difference between Syria and Clydebank as "Hell and Paradise".
Mosaab's eldest daughter, Amal, is twelve.
She has learned her first hundred words of English. It won't be long before she can join the rest of her class at her local secondary school.

===Input Doc/Src: Kayla Mueller was abducted when working in Aleppo, Syria and died last year.
The woman charged - 25-year-old Nisreen Assad Ibrahim Bahar, known as Umm Sayyaf -  is currently in Iraqi custody.
Prosecutors say Sayyaf kept Ms Mueller captive, allowing her to be repeatedly raped by IS chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
Nisreen Bahar's husband, Abu Sayyaf, is described in an affidavit as IS minister for oil and gas, reporting directly to Baghdadi.
Abu Sayyaf died last May when his compound in Syria was raided by US special forces.
His widow was handed over to the Iraqi authorities for prosecution.
A US justice department statement said they supported the prosecution but would "continue to pursue justice for Kayla".
"We will always be relentless in our efforts to identify, locate and arrest those who are responsible for the kidnappings and murders of American citizens," said the FBI's Assistant Director in Charge, Paul Abbate.

Accies survived some nervous moments before Ash Taylor headed the Dons ahead after 34 minutes.
But the lead only lasted four minutes as Dougie Imrie scored from the penalty spot after Danny Redmond was challenged by goalkeeper Joe Lewis.
Rooney pounced when Gary Woods parried a James Maddison shot, before Accies' Scott McMann was shown a late red card.
The win - thanks to the Irish striker's 11th goal this season - takes Aberdeen to within four points of second-placed Rangers in the Scottish Premiership table.
Accies remain second bottom without a victory in 10 games since beating the Dons in October.
Aberdeen were fluid and dangerous from the off, exposing Accies' weakness on the left flank, with Louis Longridge inexperienced in a full-back role against Jonny Hayes.
Mark Reynolds netted early on, but referee Andrew Dallas saw pushing and ruled it out, perhaps a touch harshly as the Dons defender didn't appear to be the culprit.
It seemed only a matter of time for the home side, with visiting defenders struggling to cope with the recurring threat.
One corner in particular caused chaos involving a Reynolds header that was saved, an overhead kick clearance and a follow up effort from Andrew Considine with the ball eventually forced behind.
Chances and corners flowed. Perhaps one criticism that could be levelled at Aberdeen was how they had not managed to score before they did.
The breakthrough came from a set piece. Hayes floated a great free-kick to Taylor, whose header was equally accurate and found the corner.
Incredibly, Hamilton were almost immediately handed a route back into the match.
Taylor blundered to let Redmond in on Lewis, who appeared to hesitate, allowing the midfielder to nick the ball.
The goalkeeper got a touch on the ball, but it was not clear whether he had taken the man first. No matter, the referee gave the penalty, which Imrie fired home confidently.
Aberdeen responded well to that set-back, with W

Army bomb disposal experts were called to the scene and the suspected explosives taken away.
The explosives are said to be enough to make three under-car booby-trap bombs.
Det Insp Stuart Griffin said considerable inconvenience had been caused to residents and he thanked them for their co-operation.
"Thankfully these suspected explosives are no longer in the public domain," he added.
The find comes two years after a similar discovery at Maeve House.
Two and a half kilos of the explosive was found in a cupboard at the building in May 2014.

===Input Doc/Src: Official documents obtained by Reuters news agency show government lawyers advised the US it might be considered a co-belligerent under international law.
The Obama administration has continued to authorise weapons sales to Saudi Arabia despite the warnings last year.
On Saturday, an air strike on a funeral hall in Sanaa killed some 140 people.
The coalition denied responsibility for the attack, but Washington said it would review its support to "better align with US principles, values and interests".
US President Barack Obama agreed to provide "logistical and intelligence support" to the coalition after it intervened in the conflict between forces loyal to Yemen's internationally-recognised government and those allied to the rebel Houthi movement in March 2015.
Since then, more than 4,125 civilians have been killed and 7,207 injured, the UN says, with air strikes believed to have caused about 60% of the deaths.
The documents detailing US government concerns about the civilian casualties and the potential legal implications for US military personnel were obtained by Reuters under the Freedom of Information Act and date from May 2015 to February 2016.
One document quotes a state department official as telling human rights groups in October 2015 that he believed coalition strikes were "not intentionally indiscriminate but rather result from a lack of Saudi experience with dropping munitions and firing missiles".
"The lack of Saudi experience is compounded by the asymmetric situation on the ground where enemy militants are not wearing uniforms and are mixed with civilian populations," the official said.
"Weak intelligence likely further compounds the problem," he added.
US officials also compiled a list of "critical infrastructure" that should be spared to enable Yemenis to restart commercial access and deliver humanitarian aid.

The ultimate childhood tennis dream had been realised in one perfect draw - a Wimbledon wildcard leading to the British teenager facing the legendary Martina Navratilova on Centre Court.
It was 1994 and set to be nine-time champion Navratilova's farewell appearance in singles at the All England Club.
World number 360 Taylor, then 19, was steadily climbing the rankings, had just beaten a player in the top 50 at Eastbourne and would normally have had the unwavering support of the home crowd.
But ruining a legend's day would not have gone down well.
"When we came out they gave her a standing ovation for what seemed like forever, so I stood at the net like a doughnut waiting for her," Taylor, now Claire Shepherd after marrying Dean in 2013, told BBC Sport.
"It didn't stop; it was incredible. I was just stood there and the umpire said: 'It's OK, this doesn't normally happen.'
"The crowd were definitely pro-Martina, but they were still supportive of me.
"It is just a bit of a regret that my career highlight was losing a match. I don't like that really, but it was Martina on Centre Court."
Now a tennis coach, Shepherd, 42, is still very much in love with the sport and remains a regular visitor to SW19, having been hooked long before she became Oxfordshire county champion at the age of 10.
She used go to the All England Club with her tennis-mad father Phil and join the queuing masses to get tickets, so being out on the showpiece court in front of millions watching on television felt "very strange".
The Banbury-born left-hander had made her Wimbledon debut in the ladies' doubles in 1993. But this was something else.
"We had queued many times to watch Martina so to play her was amazing," the former British number two added. "My first thought was: 'Wow, that's great.' Then, it was: 'No hold on, that's a terrible draw.'"
The innocence of youth certainly helped to deal with facing one of the greatest players ever to pick up a racque

Reed Morano, who directed the first three episodes of hit TV series The Handmaid's Tale, will direct the film.
Bond producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson said it was "exciting" to work with such a "talented" team.
Morano and Lively, they added, "have a strong vision for this very compelling story driven by a female protagonist".
The Rhythm Section is the first of four novels to feature Burnell's Stephanie Patrick heroine, inviting the prospect of a Bond-style film series.
Its announcement comes during a hiatus in production on the James Bond films, which Broccoli and Wilson have co-produced since 1995.
Production on the film will begin later this year, with financing from international production company IM Global.
Its head Stuart Ford said the film would be "fresh, realistic and bold", with "a unique female heroine who turns so many of the current cinematic cliches surrounding so-called 'kick-ass' female leads on their head".
Lively, who is married to Deadpool star Ryan Reynolds, is also known for playing the ageless heroine of the film The Age of Adeline.
Last year saw her battle a shark in The Shallows, appear in Woody Allen's Cafe Society and also give birth to her second child.

He was not in the final 23-man squad, but the Reds are seeking "clarity" from Fifa about his availability.
Germany-born Matip has not featured for Cameroon since September 2015.
Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp said: "In our understanding, Joel is officially retired from international football.
"The club did everything we had to do to make this clear, but up until now we couldn't get the response we need to be 100% sure he can play.
"It's pretty difficult and really frustrating. He has been in training four or five days. He would have been in the squad, maybe on the pitch [against United] so I don't think it's fair."
Matip was one of seven of their players who said they did not want to play at the tournament in Gabon, which started on Saturday and runs until 5 February.
Another, West Brom full-back Allan Nyom, also failed to received international clearance and did not feature in his side's 4-0 defeat at Tottenham on Saturday.
The Cameroon football association (Fecafoot) can ask world governing body Fifa to suspend those players at club level for the duration of the event.

===Input Doc/Src: In his Autumn Statement Philip Hammond said growth predictions had been cut as a result of the Brexit vote.
As widely expected, he unveiled a fuel duty freeze and more cash for housing, transport and digital infrastructure.
Labour said the government was "unprepared and ill-equipped" for Brexit and had "no vision".
Mr Hammond told MPs the UK's deficit would no longer be cleared by 2020 - with the target instead "as early as possible" afterwards.
Mr Hammond said the statement - his first major Commons event as chancellor - came exactly five months after a Brexit vote which "will change the course of Britain's history", making it "more urgent than ever" to tackle long-term economic weaknesses.
Presenting the Office for Budget Responsibility's forecasts, he said borrowing would hit £68.2bn this year and £59bn next year, compared with the March forecast of £55.5bn and £38.8bn.
The OBR said the referendum result meant potential growth in the current Parliament would be 2.4 percentage points lower than forecast in March. Government finances are forecast to be £122bn worse off than in the spring.
Among the chancellor's announcements were:
Mr Hammond said the government would prioritise "additional high-value investment" on infrastructure, which would be funded by additional borrowing.
He paid tribute to his predecessor George Osborne but said he would now follow three new fiscal rules: to balance the books "as early as possible in the next Parliament", for public sector net debt to be falling as a share of GDP by the end of Parliament and for welfare spending to be within a cap.
The OBR based its forecasts on the assumption that the UK would leave the EU in April 2019 - two years after the government's deadline for triggering negotiations with Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty.
It also assumed new trading arrangements would slow import and export growth for a decade and that migration would be restricted.

"Andre is one of the leading T20 players in the world right now," said director of cricket Mick Newell.
Russell has taken 180 wickets in T20 cricket at an average of 26.13, and has 12 half-centuries with the bat with a strike rate of more than 165 runs per 100 balls.
Newell added: "Looking at our line-up, there was certainly scope to add a hitter into the middle order, as we did in 2015 with Darren Sammy.
"In Andre's case it's an added bonus that he's a very effective fast bowler as well."
Tahir played three matches for Notts towards the end of last season.
He has taken 150 wickets in international and domestic T20 cricket at 20.82, with an economy rate below seven.
"We've seen many times how valuable a world-class leg-spinner can be, in all formats of the game," said Newell.

Police Scotland said it believed the incident was contained and there was not a threat to the wider community.
A blue forensics tent had been erected inside a police cordon at the foot of the building, close to the main entrance.
An eyewitness said they saw a man fall from the 12th floor of the building, which police confirmed they were pursuing as a line of inquiry.
Another witness, Toni Dey, 19, who lives a short distance away in Gordon's Mills Road, said she heard screaming from the block.
The mother of two said: "I heard some girl screaming 'Help me, help me', then about 10 minutes after I heard loads of screaming and shouting.
"I didn't call the police as I thought it was kids messing around, then I heard loads of police.
"It's very scary to think that something like that had happened. All I kept thinking was 'Why was that poor girl shouting help me?', and about a two-minute walk out my back door.
"I just moved in here in May and it's been so quiet. I was shocked to hear anything as I never normally do."
Another woman told BBC Scotland that she had known one of the men involved, describing him as a "nice boy".
Det Supt Dave McLaren said further information about the incident would be released in due course.
"At this time the investigation is in its very early stages," he said.
"However, the circumstances as they present at this time would indicate that this is a contained incident and we are not looking for any other person in relation to the deaths."
Police dismissed reports on social media that a police officer had been injured and said there was no suggestion the incident was terrorism-related.

===Input Doc/Src: The five were a 16-year-old girl, who died in Great Victoria Street on Monday, and four men who died in different parts of the city.
Police did not confirm which three cases are suspected to be drugs-related but no single, common drug is involved.
Earlier, a senior officer said all five deaths may have involved drugs.
But a Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) spokeswoman later clarified that detectives suspect drug misuse may have been a factor in only three of the deaths.
Post-mortem examinations are being carried out and toxicology reports have been ordered.
The first of the five sudden deaths took place in Verner Street in Belfast city centre on Friday, 31 March.
The other four people, including the teenaged girl, all died on Monday:
Police said that number of deaths in such a short time frame was unusual, but that they were not linking any of them at present.
Ch Supt Tim Mairs said: "Investigations are at an early stage, but I would like to take the opportunity to reinforce the dangers posed by taking any illegal drugs or any medication that is not prescribed for you.
"Drugs misuse can affect anyone and we recognise that many vulnerable people are being exploited for the financial gain of those higher up the supply chain."
He added: "The number of deaths in Northern Ireland connected to drug use is on the increase and this is a concern.
"Sadly, these are all preventable. In fact, more people are dying from misuse of opioid drugs in Northern Ireland than in road fatalities, which is a very stark reality."
---Sum/Tgt: Five sudden deaths in greater Belfast over the past few days are being investigated, with police saying three of the cases may have involved drugs.

He was detained as part of an intelligence-led operation after a concerned family member is believed to have contacted the police.
Police said he remains in custody and can be questioned until 11 May.
It comes after a warrant of further detention was granted at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Wednesday.
Mr Ali is thought to be a UK national - but born overseas - and to have gone to school in Tottenham, north London.
He was arrested in Parliament Street, at the junction with Parliament Square, following a stop and search as part of an ongoing operation, police said.

===Input Doc/Src: Chief prosecutor Tomas Lindstrand said police were "98% sure" that the man was Iraq-born Taimour Abdulwahab al-Abdaly.
Abdaly, 28, is believed to have died minutes after setting off a car bomb on Saturday. Two other people were hurt.
Seven US FBI bomb experts are heading to Stockholm to help the investigation, Sweden's intelligence agency said.
Although Abdaly was a Swedish citizen, he had been living in the UK.
British police have been searching a house in Luton, north of London, where Abdaly lived.
Mr Lindstrand said Swedish police were now trying to work out what the bomber's target had been before he blew himself up prematurely.
"He had a bomb belt on him, he had a backpack with a bomb and he was carrying an object that has been compared to a pressure cooker. If it had all blown up at the same time, it would have been very powerful," he said.
A car containing gas canisters blew up first in a busy shopping street in the area of Drottninggatan at 1700 local time (1600 GMT) followed minutes later by a explosion in a street about 300m (985ft) away that killed the bomber.
Abdaly was named as the registered owner of the car.
Mr Lindstrand said they believed the bomber had intended to kill "as many people as possible".
"Where he was headed... we don't know," he said.
"It is likely that something happened, that he made some kind of mistake [and] part of the bombs he was carrying went off and caused his death.
"This was during Christmas shopping in central Stockholm and he was extremely well-equipped when it came to bomb material. It is not much of a stretch to say he was going to a place with as many people as possible."
Mr Lindstrand said possible targets included the city's central train station or to Aahlens, a popular department store.
In a profile on the Muslim dating website Muslima, Abdaly said he was born in Baghdad and moved to Sweden in 1992, before arriving in the UK in 2001 to study.
He said he had got married in 2004 and had two young daughters.

===Input Doc/Src: Chelsea Manning, whose sentence was commuted by the outgoing president, thanked him "for giving me a chance".
The 29-year-old transgender soldier, born Bradley Manning, gave embarrassing documents to Wikileaks in 2010.
At President Obama's final press conference on Wednesday, he declared that "justice has been served".
She will be freed from the Fort Leavenworth military prison in May - 29 years ahead of her scheduled release in 2045.
Wikileaks founder Julian Assange weighed in on Thursday, insisting that he would stand by his offer to be extradited to the US as long as his rights were protected.
Mr Assange, who agreed to be extradited to the US if Mr Obama granted clemency to Manning, has been holed up at the Ecuadorian embassy in London since 2012.
The Australian national sought refuge there to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he is wanted for questioning in relation to an alleged sex offence.
"I stand by everything I said including the offer to go to the United States if Chelsea Manning's sentence was commuted," he said in a live online audio news conference on Thursday.
"It's not going to be commuted (until) May. We can have many discussions to that point," he added.
The White House said Manning's commutation had not been influenced in any way by Mr Assange's offer, and the US justice department has not indicted Mr Assange nor publicly sought his extradition.
Obama says justice is served
Viewpoint: Obama got it right
Mr Obama's last-minute commutation quickly drew criticism from Republican circles.
A spokesman for president-elect Donald Trump said he "is troubled by this action. It's disappointing and it sends a very troubling message when it comes to the handling of classified information".
Republican Speaker of the House Paul Ryan called the decision "outrageous".
"Chelsea Manning's treachery put American lives at risk and exposed some of our nation's most sensitive secrets," Mr Ryan said.

===Input Doc/Src: The White Rabbit, the Cheshire Cat and Alice all feature in artist Grahame Baker-Smith's illustrations.
The story was made up by Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, a young don at Christ Church in Oxford, to entertain children on a boat trip in 1862.
It was published under Dodgson's pseudonym, Lewis Carroll, three years later.
One of the children on the Thames boat trip was Alice Liddel, the daughter of the dean of the college.
Alice later asked for the story, originally entitled Alice's Adventures Under Ground, to be written down. Dodgson did so as a Christmas gift in 1864 with his own illustrations.
It went on to become one of the best known works in children's literature, with numerous TV and film adaptations.
The stamps feature famous scenes from the book including the Mad Hatter's tea party and Alice falling down the rabbit hole.
Illustrator Grahame Baker-Smith said he had based the images of Alice on the stamps on his own daughter.
"The most difficult thing was consistency and working on such a very small scale. They all have to work as a set, so you want to have a range of colour and tone across the 10 stamps.
"The Royal Mail has a rich history of illustration on stamps, so the chance to have a go at that is a great opportunity."
Andrew Hammond, Royal Mail director of stamps and collectibles, said: "The story of Alice in Wonderland remains a perennial favourite of children, and indeed adults, around the world.
"It is fitting that in its 150th anniversary year it is celebrated with a wonderful set of stamps featuring striking images that do justice to such an iconic tale."

===Input Doc/Src: Pleas for leniency from the inmates, families and diplomats were rejected by President Joko Widodo.
But the execution of a Filipina who was also on death row was unexpectedly postponed.
Another death row convict, a Frenchmen, was not executed because he still has an outstanding legal complaint over the rejection of his clemency appeal.
Who are the prisoners and how did they end up on death row?
Sukumaran, 34, was an Australian citizen, born in London. In 2006, a court in Bali found him guilty of being the ringleader of the Bali Nine - a group of Australians arrested in Bali with more than 18lb (8.3kg) of heroin.
He was given the death penalty in 2006, and his plea for clemency was rejected in December 2014.
His advocates claimed he had reformed since entering prison, teaching other inmates English and art. He also became an accomplished artist himself. However, all attempts to appeal against his sentence failed.
Chan, 31, was an Australian who was given the death penalty along with Myuran Sukumaran.
He was arrested in Ngurah Rai airport in Bali in April 2005. A court found him guilty of planning the smuggling of 18lb heroin with the group known as the Bali Nine.
His plea for clemency was rejected in January 2015. Like Sukumaran, other legal challenges all failed.
His supporters claimed he had turned over a new leaf and and ran Bible study classes in Bali's Kerobokan jail.
There is some confusion surrounding Anderson's nationality. Initial reports said he was Ghanaian, but it was later reported he had travelled to Indonesia on a false passport and was in fact Nigerian.

Badarudin was the only Indonesian citizen amongst the group. He was born in Palembang and was found guilty of the possession of 129lb of marijuana.

===Input Doc/Src: His journey towards the Rio 2016 Paralympic Games as a para-canoeist has been one filled with life-changing obstacles and defined by a steely resolve.
He began as a record-breaking junior world champion powerlifter. Then, after suffering a serious spinal injury, he embarked on an illustrious handcycling career.
Marsden raced on the European circuit while based in the Czech Republic, before a neck problem again saw him admitted into the University Hospital of North Staffordshire in 2009 for what he thought was a prolapsed disc.
Instead it was revealed that he suffers with a rare motor-neurone condition which affects his arms, legs and brain.
"Through powerlifting I damaged my back many years ago, and after that I managed to damage my neck and had a couple of plates and (carbon) cage put in," the 44-year-old from Stoke-on-Trent told BBC East Midlands Today.
In a matter-of-fact manner, Marsden says his sporting journey "has not been an easy one".
When handcycling was no longer an option, he took up air rifle shooting and set his sights on London 2012, but while more representative honours came his way, he missed out on the Paralympics.
Eventually, he turned to the water where he was able to combine aspects of his his first two sporting loves - powerlifting and handcycling - together in one explosive sport.
"I didn't want to give up on sport," he said. "The cycling and powerlifting work quite well with the para-canoe - the gym work, the power and strength and then you have the endurance and speed work on the bike."
The two-time para-canoe European champion and two-time world silver medallist now wants to realise his Paralympic ambition in Brazil when the British line-up is decided at the trials in Nottingham in June.
"It would be the highlight of my sporting career," Marsden said.
"As a kid I watched TV and watched the Olympics. I've seen how the Paralympics has built up over the years, from not really knowing what it was about to the status it has now, with athletes be

She designs bespoke children's furniture which all come with an individual story book. The products are manufactured in Poland.
Zandra lives with her husband in a comfortable, leafy suburb, in Hertfordshire. She says she was not forced into self-employment financially - she simply wanted to unleash her creative side.
"I suppose it was all the ideas I had, they were so different and there were so many of them," she enthuses.
"I did a lot of market research and the response I got was, 'Yes that's great, we'd sell that.' So I progressed from there."
She launched Fairytale Furniture at the onset of the recession and has survived the downturn. Now in its sixth year of trading, she hopes to finally turn a profit.
Zandra is already exporting to South Africa, Dubai and Singapore and has her eye on cracking the US market. She buys in expertise, when needed, including a marketing expert and an export adviser.
She loves the flexibility of being self-employed.
"I can work at midnight if I want to, I can take a longer lunch if I want to - especially when the weather is good - and I can make the time up later. I just love it, I love all of it. It's fun."
Self-employment is one of the big stories of the recovery. One in seven workers in the UK are now working for themselves.

In fact, there are now 780,000 more people in employment than there were this time last year, and 40% of those are self-employed.
Over the longer term, the biggest rise in self-employment has been seen in the number of older workers. According to the ONS, self-employment among the over-50s is up 36% on 10 years ago.

===Input Doc/Src: On Monday, Rick Maddison fatally shot Senior Constable Brett Forte after the police officer intercepted his car in Queensland.
He fled to a nearby farmhouse and spent the night in a stand-off with police.
Maddison was killed by authorities after fleeing the house and firing on police, Queensland Police Assistant Commissioner Tony Wright said.
"He has been challenged by police at that point in time - he has fired at those police," he told reporters on Tuesday.
"Specialist police have returned fire. The male person has been shot and that male person has been declared deceased at the scene."
Mr Forte was killed after intercepting Maddison, who police had described as a "wanted person", about 14:20 local time (04:20 GMT) on Monday.
Authorities had set up an exclusion zone around the farm and began negotiating with Maddison at midnight.
The confrontation happened just after 11:00.
On Monday, Queensland Police Commissioner Ian Stewart said he wanted to resolve the siege "as peacefully as humanly possible".
Residents nearby residents were ordered to evacuate their homes on Monday evening.
Mr Forte was a husband and father who had been a police officer for more than 15 years, authorities said.
"It is so distressing - not just to the police service - but to the community, that we have lost a fine police officer," Mr Stewart said.
Queensland Police Union president Ian Leavers said the officer was shot "simply trying to apprehend a wanted person".
"It could have been any one of us anywhere in Australia," he told the Seven Network.

===Input Doc/Src: Rod Mackenzie, described as a life-long crofter, was one of six commissioners elected in March and represents the East Highlands.
Mr Ewing said the appointment would bring stability to the Crofting Commission.
The regulatory body had been involved in a lengthy row that saw calls for the last convener to resign.
Earlier this year, Scottish ministers urged for action to address "worrying failures" indentified by a review of the commission.
The review ordered by the government found "personality clashes" amid issues with management at the organisation.
Crofting is carried out in the Highlands, Northern and Western Isles and Argyll.
Mr Ewing said: "As a life-long crofter, Mr Mackenzie will bring a wealth of knowledge and experience to the role and I look forward to working collaboratively with him in the future.
"With the appointment of the new convener, the creation of the new board of commissioners and the recruitment of a new chief executive earlier this year, I believe crofting can look forward to a period of stability and a positive focus on issues that will greatly improve the lives of those living in remote and rural areas."
Mr Mackenzie said he was delighted to be selected for the role.
He said: "We've had several meetings of the board of commissioners since the elections in March, both for business and for training as a new group coming together and I've been impressed by just that - how everyone wants to come together, to do a good job for crofting.
"And what I've quickly learnt is that it is no simple thing. As a public regulator, you are working within constraints - there's no magic wand.
"But what there is, is the will to work together to make a difference."

===Input Doc/Src: It was a role he relished and he often returned to it over a period of four decades.
He was a consummate character actor who took on a wide variety of roles on stage, screen and television.
And despite playing Johnny Speight's infamous creation for such a long time, he managed to avoid being typecast as Britain's favourite bigot.
Warren Mitchell was actually born as Warren Misell on 14 January 1926 in north London.
His father, Monty, was English, while his mother Annie, who died when he was 15, was of Russian descent.
He was chosen, aged five, to play Tiny Tim in his primary school's production of A Christmas Carol but never made the stage.
His Orthodox Jewish grandmother vetoed the idea when she learned he would be breaking Jewish dietary law by eating Christmas pudding containing suet.
In later years he developed a pathological loathing of Christmas, referring to it as "all that sentimental crap".
However, his interest in acting grew and, at the age of seven, he was enrolled in Gladys Gordon's Academy of Dramatic Arts in Walthamstow, east London.
He also developed a love of football, becoming a staunch supporter of Tottenham Hotspur.
He did well at school and went on to read physical chemistry at University College, Oxford, where he met Richard Burton, who encouraged his interest in acting.
They joined the RAF together in 1944 and Mitchell was sent to Canada to train as a navigator, although the war ended before he saw active service.
Mitchell enrolled for a two-year course at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, spending his evenings performing with the left-wing Unity Theatre in London, where he met his wife, Connie.
Because she was an Anglican, Mitchell's Jewish father initially refused to have Connie in the house, but he eventually came round to the idea of his son marrying outside his faith.

===Input Doc/Src: The Federal Anti-Monopoly Service (Fas) said that Apple's local subsidiary told 16 retailers to maintain the recommended prices of phones in the iPhone 5 and iPhone 6 families.
Non-compliance with the pricing guidelines may have led to the termination of contracts, it found.
Apple has not yet responded to a request for comment.
At the time of the investigation, Apple denied that it controlled its products' pricing, telling Reuters that resellers "set their own prices for the Apple products they sell in Russia and around the world".
The regulator said Apple had now ended its price-fixing practices but has not said whether the company faces a fine.
The FAS claimed that Apple Rus monitored the retail prices for the iPhone 5c, 5s, 6, 6 Plus, 6s and 6s Plus.
"In the case of the establishment of 'inappropriate' prices, the Russian subsidiary of Apple sent emails to resellers asking them to change," the watchdog said.
The deputy head of the FAS, Andrey Tsarikovsky, added that "Apple actively co-operated" with the investigation and that the company had "adopted the necessary measures to eliminate violations of the law".
That included training employees in the "anti-monopoly legislation norms" in Russia.
In May, the FAS found that Google used its dominant position to force its own apps and services on users and fined it Â£5m ($6m).
And, in November, the regulator opened an investigation into whether Microsoft abused its position in the security market with Windows 10, following a complaint from Moscow-based anti-virus firm Kaspersky.

Ali had denied the indecency offence committed at houses in Dunfermline but was found guilty by a majority verdict at the High Court in Edinburgh.
He was found guilty of abusing the girl when she was aged between seven and 11, up to August 2003.
The victim, now aged 22, gave evidence against Ali, who is from Dunfermline.
Defence solicitor advocate John Scott QC asked that Ali's bail be continued after the verdict.
He said Ali had no criminal record of any significance and no breaches of bail.
Mr Scott said: "Whilst a custodial sentence is all but inevitable, there is no reason to think he would fail to comply with bail conditions."
The judge told Ali: "You have been convicted of a serious sexual offence."
Lady Wise said she was prepared to continue his bail while a background report was prepared ahead of sentencing next month.
But she told Ali: "You should not be under any illusion that says anything about the ultimate disposal."

Thursday's election ended the unionist majority at Stormont, with Sinn Féin now just one seat behind the DUP.
Talks are being held to restore the power-sharing executive, but parties have just three weeks to reach a deal.
The five main party leaders have held a series of bilateral talks on Tuesday, as well as separate discussions with Mr Brokenshire.
Sinn Féin said it had further discussions with the secretary of state regarding money for inquests into the most controversial killings of the Troubles but that he had come to "no good conclusion".
"Some families have been waiting 45 years and this affects all victims, regardless of the perpetrators," said party leader Gerry Adams.
"They need to get those inquests under way and they have been delayed because the British refuse to give the funds."
The party also met with the DUP and further meetings were planned, said Mr Adams. He added this was an indication that issues were being tackled.
Meanwhile, the head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, Sir Malcolm McKibbin, said one of the most difficult issues facing the administration was the absence of a budget to cover the financial year from next month.
Sir Malcolm said there was a "small window of opportunity" to allow a new executive to agree a budget and put it to the Assembly.
On Tuesday morning, DUP leader Arlene Foster met her party's freshly elected MLAs (members of the legislative assembly) and said she was "delighted" with their support.

The UK Scout Association said the on-site medical team and local paramedics "rendered immediate support but unfortunately were unable to save him".
Spokesman Simon Carter said it was in touch with the families of the children at the jamboree, which more than 16,000 people are attending.
"We will be working with the Finnish Scout movement and the relevant local authorities to establish the full details of this tragic incident," he added.
More than 2,800 scouts from more than 40 countries are attending the jamboree in the south of Finland.
Memorial services have been held at the event in tribute to Charlie.
Anna Munsterhjelm, chief scout in Finland, said: "The Guides and Scouts of Finland and Finnjamboree Roihu express their deepest condolences to the friends and family of the tragic medical situation that resulted in the death of a scout.
"The loss has moved thousands of people within and outside the camp.
"The camp has professional crisis counsellors that are making their utmost best that everybody has the support they require." (sic)
Charlie had been a Year 7 pupil at Maplesden Noakes School, in Maidstone.
Head teacher Jane Prideaux said staff were "deeply shocked and saddened" by his death.

Other artists taking part include Grayson Perry, Cornelia Parker, Jenny Saville, David Shrigley and Douglas Gordon as well as The Chapman Brothers and Sir Peter Blake, with seven Turner prize winners among them.
Each artist was sent a piece of material specifically chosen for them with a note telling them what it was, where it was from and explaining the concept of the auction.
Perry, who has made an urn featuring the words "Art is dead. Long live Art", said: "It's a tragedy. It's the most famous art school building in Britain.
"It's also the masterpiece of Mackintosh. It's a double tragedy.
"I was very excited when I received the box of charcoal. I had an idea almost immediately and the idea of making an urn was an obvious thing to do.
"The idea of memorialising or celebrating the difficulty - honouring the wound. It's something I'm trying to do. Move on and make the most of it.
"I really like the idea of using the charcoal from the fire. I thought it was very clever. It's also fresh - it's not something that has come up before.
"We've all been asked to do T-shirts, knickers and mugs - endless charity rounds. I get about two a week."
The project, titled Ash To Art, was created by communications agency J. Walter Thompson London in collaboration with The Glasgow School of Art Development Trust.
The work will be on display at Christie's in London's King Street from 3-7 March and will be auctioned during the Post-War and Contemporary Art Day Sale on 8 March.
Each of the pieces, covering a range of practices including sculpture, photography, drawing and painting, has been created using remains from the fire, from charred timbers and debris to books and furniture.

===Input Doc/Src: The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority said there appeared to be no "material" reason to alter its proposal, first put forward in 2013.
Unless "new evidence" emerged, MPs' pay will rise from £67,060 to £74,000.
David Cameron opposes the move but has said he will not block the increase, saying MPs' pay is a matter for Ipsa.
Ipsa was handed control of decisions over MPs' pay and expenses in the wake of the 2009 expenses scandal. It does not need to get the agreement of Parliament to bring in the changes.
The UK's 650 MPs are currently paid £67,060. Their pay would rise to £74,000 under Ipsa's final plans.
The PM has previously urged the watchdog to scrap the above-inflation increase, which was initially proposed to address complaints that pay had fallen behind the rest of the public sector.
But in its final consultation on the proposals, Ipsa restated its intention to press ahead with the increase, saying there appeared to be no "material" reason to change the recommendations.
Unless "new and compelling evidence" emerged by the end of June the pay rise - to be backdated to 8 May - would be confirmed, it said.
Ipsa said that due to cuts in pensions and expenses - such as a ban on claiming for evening meals - the overall package of changes would not cost taxpayers "a penny more".
Ministers are set to benefit from the increase to MPs' pay - as only the government element of their salaries has been frozen for five years under plans announced by David Cameron in the wake of the Conservatives' election victory.
Commenting on the final proposals, the PM's spokeswoman said: "Throughout this process and debate, the prime minister has been absolutely clear that he doesn't agree with the proposed increase.
"But ultimately it is up to Ipsa as an independent body to decide MPs' pay and it is for them to make their determination."
She added that Mr Cameron's focus was on areas where he had the power to bring down the cost of politics, including proposals for boundary cha

Mr Cabello dismissed the accusations, saying no proof had been offered.
In March the US imposed sanctions on a group of Venezuelan officials.
Venezuelan opposition leaders and US officials have previously made similar accusations against the governments of President Nicolas Maduro and his predecessor Hugo Chavez.
Mr Cabello is both president of the National Assembly and the second most senior official in the governing Socialist Party.
Last month he filed a defamation suit against 22 people linked to various media outlets who had republished details of the US accusations.
Correspondents say he sees the accusations as part of a campaign to discredit the country's socialist achievements and to destabilise it months before a parliamentary election.
The US has sanctioned at least 50 Venezuelan government officials whom it accuses of drug-trafficking and human rights abuses.
In December, President Barack Obama signed a decree classifying Venezuela as a "security threat".
Last month the 11 members of the Alba group of Latin America countries urged him to repeal the decree and made clear they backed Venezuela.

Three Syrian rebel groups have expressed doubts to the BBC over the cessation of hostilities agreement:

World media on Syria plan
Agreement to try to bring about a cessation of hostilities and allow more access for humanitarian aid was reached by world powers late on Thursday in Germany, but neither the Syrian government nor the rebels were involved.
So far there has been no sign of the UN realising its hopes of delivering aid imminently to more besieged areas.
A new UN task force set up to co-ordinate aid distributions convened in Geneva on Friday.
Some Syrian cities have been cut off from aid for more than a year because of fighting. About 13.5 million people are in need, the UN says.
In his rare interview recorded on Thursday, Mr Assad told AFP news agency that defeating the groups ranged against him could take some time due to the involvement of regional powers.
Mr Assad expressed support for peace talks but said negotiations did not mean "we stop fighting terrorism". And he vowed to sever the rebels' supply route from Turkey.
Syrian government forces, backed by Russian air strikes, have almost encircled rebels in parts of the northern city of Aleppo.

It is the latest in a series of steps by Mr Abadi to ease sectarian tensions and crack down on corruption.
Baghdad has seen weeks of protests over poor services and abuses of power.
Earlier this month, in a rare show of unity, the Iraqi parliament backed Mr Abadi's programme to abolish top government posts and cut spending.
On Friday, the prime minister issued instructions to lift restrictions on the Green Zone. It is not clear when the plan will be implemented.
The compound, in the Karkh district on the west bank of the Tigris, is surrounded by concrete walls and heavily guarded by checkpoints and tanks.
It houses former palaces of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein and was the administrative headquarters of the US occupation authorities. Several foreign embassies, including those of the US and UK, are situated there.
Most Iraqis have been excluded from the Green Zone unless they have special permission, and large bribes have been paid to get round stringent entry procedures, according to AFP news agency.
The zone has been targeted by bombings and rockets over the years, and the fortification measures were aimed at making it more secure, although attacks in Baghdad are still commonplace.
Mr Abadi also ordered the removal of barriers and checkpoints set up on main roads and sidestreets in Baghdad and elsewhere by prominent figures and militias.
The order to lift the restrictions is part of a series of measures to defuse tensions and root out corruption. A panel will also be set up to recover state property appropriated by elites which are found to have been illegally obtained.

City are now 10 points behind leaders Chelsea after defeat on Merseyside - the heaviest league loss in Guardiola's managerial career.
Asked if the gap was too great, he said: "Yes. Ten is a lot of points."
Guardiola, 45, has told his players to unite "in the bad moments" and "forget the table" until the end of the season.
He added: "At the end of the season, we are going to evaluate our level and how our performance was, how the coach was, how the players were. After that we are going to decide."
The former Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss insisted he was "so happy in Manchester" despite his side sitting fifth, two points behind fourth-placed Arsenal.
Guardiola watched City dominate possession on Merseyside but concede four from the six shots they faced.
Only five teams have a lower haul than their four clean sheets in the league - BBC Radio 5 live pundit Robbie Savage said City "cannot defend" and questioned if Guardiola would now change his style.
City are the only team in the Premier League to have over 50% of possession in every game this season but they have now conceded from the first shot they have faced in four of their last seven games.
Guardiola added: "I said to the players be positive because you made some fantastic things during the season and for many reasons we didn't get what I think we deserved.
"In the bad moments we have to be close. It's awful for my players. We created chances but don't score and when they have a chance, they punish us."
Everton scored with their first two shots through Romelu Lukaku and Kevin Mirallas, with Tom Davies and Ademola Lookman completing the rout.
Lookman's goal came after a John Stones clearance was charged down, throwing the young defender again under the spotlight.
It was Stones' first visit to Goodison Park since leaving Everton for City in a £47.5m deal last summer.

===Input Doc/Src: The ruling by a US district judge is the latest twist in a long-running legal battle going back to 2013.
Costco, which is to appeal against the decision, argues that "Tiffany" is now a generic term for the rings.
But it has now been told it must call them "Tiffany-style" instead.
The dispute centres on the sale of solitaire-style rings, comprising a diamond mounted on a single band with six prongs.
Costco, which had sold 2,500 of them, put them on display with the label "Tiffany", although they were not in fact made by the jeweller.
An earlier court ruling in October 2016 ordered Costco to pay $5.5m in compensatory damages and $8.25m in punitive damages.
But in a further court decision on Monday, the compensation was increased to $11.1m, while the amount of punitive damages still stands.
Kate Swaine, a partner at law firm Gowling WLG, said: "This damages award may seem excessive given that only 2,500 products were sold, but if it can be argued that an infringement is blatant and where it relates to such a well-known brand, the claimant is entitled to seek punitive damages.
"Brand owners will welcome this decision as an indication of the risk that third parties run in trying to make associations with famous brands."
The cheapest engagement ring on Tiffany's US website currently costs $12,000 (Â£9,300) while customers can buy one from Costco's website for only $380 (Â£295).

===Input Doc/Src: After the bus explosion, huge blasts were heard in the Gaza Strip as the Israeli bombardment of the Palestinian territory continued.
Eleven people were killed in Gaza on Wednesday, the health ministry said.
Unnamed Palestinian officials told news agencies a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel would be announced within hours.
After eight days of exchanges of fire between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon are now in Cairo for talks with the Egyptian president.
There were "many details to work out" before a ceasefire could be reached, Mr Ban warned.
By Kevin ConnollyBBC News, Tel Aviv
In the immediate aftermath of the  bus bombing, there was a palpable sense of shock hanging in the air around the scene.
Israel's largest city has seen nothing like this for six-and-a-half years.
One resident - when told that the news of the explosion broadcast from mosques in Gaza has been greeted with a sound of celebratory gunfire there - said that they need to celebrate this as some kind of victory because they have nothing else to offer but violence.
A police helicopter still circled overhead and there were roadblocks at many main junctions around the scene as police hunted for the bomber or bombers seen running away from the scene.
Paradoxically, the explosion and the waves of Israeli air raids on Gaza this morning do not necessarily mean that the search for a ceasefire is dead.
It may mean that both sides are sending a signal that if a deal is agreed, they will be reaching it from what they regard as a position of strength.
The search for a diplomatic solution reaches a critical phase this afternoon when US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton meets Egyptian President Mohammed Mursi - the only leader with effective lines of communication both to Israel and to Hamas.

===Input Doc/Src: Four charities withdrew as official partners from the Kiltwalk earlier this year and its chief executive stepped down a few weeks later.
The Kiltwalk stages sponsored walks across Scotland to raise money for leading children's charities.
Its 2013 accounts showed more was spent on costs than went to charity.
There is no suggestions regulations were broken.
Kiltwalk chairman Michael Ure said it had incurred additional costs because of a "re-structuring".
Mr Ure and the rest of the trustees have now stood down.
The Kiltwalk said a new board would oversee the continued development of the charity.
The group has also attracted support from one of Scotland's richest men, the entrepreneur Sir Tom Hunter, whose foundation has committed long-term funding.
Mr Hunter said: "The Kiltwalk is a fantastic concept for raising much-needed funds for Scotland's children's charities and has our absolute support.
"We intend over the next couple of months to redefine and improve the model, building on the foundations already in place, to maximise returns for charities and turbo-charge Scotland's Kiltwalkers for 2016."
The Kiltwalk was set up in 2011 with the aim of bringing Scotland's leading children's charities together for a series of sponsored walks.
It grew from 800 walkers that year to more than 12,000 across the country in 2014.
However, earlier this year four charities - CLIC Sargent, Cash for Kids, Aberlour and Edinburgh's Sick Kids Friends Foundation - withdrew as official partners.
CLIC Sargent and Aberlour indicated to BBC Scotland that they had concerns over the amount of money reaching them from the Kiltwalk.
The most recent set of accounts for the Kiltwalk showed that from an income of just over Â£1.6m, Â£780,000 had been spent on running costs - more than the Â£776,000 which went to charity.

The Lowland League side take on East of Scotland League outfit Lothian Thistle Hutchison Vale for the right to host Celtic in the competition's last 16.
"I was sitting with my wee girl about to change her nappy. I just jumped up and went mad," said Russell.
Asked where the nappy ended up, he replied, "I don't know!"
The centre-back said he told his girlfriend, who was also watching the draw being made at Hampden, he was certain that when his own team and Vale's names were pulled out that Celtic's would follow.
However, the 26-year-old plumbing and heating engineer confessed he might struggle to focus on his job in the coming days.
"I think my boss will understand if I try to put my head down a toilet or something," he joked.
"I tried to go the gym. I was sitting on the bike just shaking my head."
Russell and his team-mates are determined to focus on their rearranged home game at K Park against Vale on 20 January, but the prospect of the Scottish champions playing at their tiny Lanarkshire ground inevitably seeps into the conversation.
So, can he imagine Celtic manager Ronny Deila watching him play from the stand?
"I'll put it out my head and make sure we get the win," he replied matter-of-factly.
"But after the game if he wants to talk contracts I'll be free!"

They will be joined by country artists Toby Keith and Bobby Braddock and blues pioneer Willie Dixon.
The ceremony will take place on 18 June in New York.
Songwriters Hall of Fame president Linda Moran said: "Each one of these brilliant music creators have written instantly recognisable classics, songs that are both of their time and timeless."
Cyndi Lauper became a household name by covering Robert Hazard's Girls Just Wanna Have Fun in the 1980s - but she has also had hits of her own and won a Tony Award in 2013 for best score for the hit Broadway musical Kinky Boots.
Linda Perry was a member of 4 Non Blondes and has written hits for stars including Pink, Gwen Stefani and Alicia Keys. One of her biggest successes was Beautiful, which was a worldwide hit for Christina Aguilera.
Toby Keith has sold more than 40 million albums worldwide, while Braddock is a songwriter who has had a career of more than 40 years and is the only living person to have written number one country hits in five consecutive decades.
His songs have become country music standards, including DIVORCE, recorded by Tammy Wynette.
Willie Dixon, who died in 1992, was one of the most prolific songwriters of all time, he has been called "the poet laureate of the blues".
His most famous compositions include Hoochie Coochie Man, I Just Want to Make Love to You and You Can't Judge a Book by the Cover.
Dixon's songs have been recorded by artists including Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin and the Rolling Stones.
The songwriters were chosen from a list that also included Tom Petty, Vince Gill, Elvis Costello and Kenneth Babyface Edmonds.

===Input Doc/Src: This is probably because starch in spuds can trigger a sharp rise in blood sugar levels, they say.
Their study in the BMJ tracked more than 21,000 pregnancies.
But UK experts say proof is lacking and lots of people need to eat more starchy foods for fibre, as well as fresh fruit and veg.
The BMJ study linked high potato consumption to a higher diabetes risk.
Swapping a couple of servings a week for other vegetables should counter this, say the authors.
UK dietary advice says starchy foods (carbohydrates) such as potatoes should make up about a third of the food people eat.
There is no official limit on how much carbohydrate people should consume each week.
Foods that contain carbohydrates affect blood sugar.
Some - high Glycaemic Index (GI) foods - release the sugar quickly into the bloodstream.
Others - low GI foods - release them more steadily.
Research suggests eating a low GI diet can help manage diabetes.
Pregnancy puts extra demands on the body, and some women develop diabetes at this time.
Gestational diabetes, as it is called, usually goes away after the birth but can pose long-term health risks for the mother and baby.
The BMJ study set out investigate what might make some women more prone to pregnancy diabetes.
The study followed nurses who became pregnant between 1991 and 2001. None of them had any chronic diseases before pregnancy.
Every four years, the women were asked to provide information on how often potatoes featured in their diets, and any cases of gestational diabetes were noted.
Over the 10-year period, there were 21,693 pregnancies and 854 of these were affected by gestational diabetes.
The study took into account other risk factors, such as:
It found a 27% increased risk of diabetes during pregnancy in the nurses who typically ate two to four 100g (3.5oz) servings of boiled, mashed, baked potatoes or chips a week.
In those who ate more than five portions of potatoes or chips a week, the risk went up by 50%.

===Input Doc/Src: The case - which has seen the faces of the judges involved splashed across newspaper front pages -  began its proceedings through the Supreme Court on Monday.
There, the UK government will appeal against the ruling of the High Court, which said MPs should be able to vote on the starting-whistle to leave the European Union.
They will be joined by a number of other parties which are intervening, including the Scottish and Welsh governments.
In a nutshell, it is over whether ministers can use executive powers to start the process of leaving the EU without consulting MPs.
Ministers hold what are known as royal prerogative powers which allow them to take decisions without Parliament's approval.
The case brought by claimants - the investment manager Gina Miller and hairdresser Dier Dos Santos - was that the government cannot use these powers to override rights enshrined in acts of Parliament.
High Court judges agreed, but the UK government rejects this argument and has appealed to the Supreme Court.
The BBC legal correspondent Clive Coleman explains the case in more detail here.
The Welsh Government has been allowed to intervene in the case, arguing that triggering Article 50 would "significantly change" how devolution works.
Permission to intervene means ministers will have their case heard in front of Supreme Court judges.
Counsel General Mick Antoniw argues that triggering Article 50 changes the powers of the assembly and the Welsh Government, and that this cannot be done without a vote in Parliament.
The Welsh Government claims a large number of its functions come from EU law and will "be lost upon the UK's withdrawal from the EU Treaties".
Separately, the counsel general's case sets out that triggering Article 50 will effectively circumvent the Sewel Convention, a set of rules that mean any attempt to change a law in a devolved area of policy needs the consent of AMs.
Mr Antoniw does not ask state that the assembly has a legally enforceable right to veto any Westmins

===Input Doc/Src: Ms Saunders will head the Crown Prosecution Service when Keir Starmer stands down in October.
The career CPS lawyer has overseen some of the country's most important prosecutions and is currently the organisation's London chief.
The DPP is the most senior criminal prosecutor in England and Wales, responsible for more than 6,800 staff.
By Clive ColemanLegal correspondent, BBC News
The role of Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) is critical within the criminal justice system of England and Wales.
The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) is the organisation that can deliver justice by making independent decisions as to whether there is sufficient evidence to charge a suspect, and when it decides that there is, by prosecuting the case effectively.
It works closely with the police but must always be seen to make independent and dispassionate decisions based upon the evidence gathered.
It can only prosecute when it concludes that there is sufficient evidence for there to be a realistic prospect of conviction, and that the prosecution is in the public interest.
The DPP is the hands-on, day-to-day head of the CPS - which is currently negotiating a period of austerity and modernisation. Maintaining public confidence in it will be critical.
The Attorney General, Dominic Grieve, said: "Alison will make an excellent director of public prosecutions and is the right person to help the Crown Prosecution Service meet the challenges it will face in the coming years.
"I am particularly pleased that Alison is the first head of the CPS to be appointed from within its ranks as proof of the high quality of the professionals that work within the service.
"I'd also like to thank Keir Starmer for the great contribution he has made - not only to the CPS but more generally to the criminal justice system.  He can be proud of the reforms that he and his staff have led to keep our criminal justice system one of the best in the world."

===Input Doc/Src: Arpad Kore and Bartosz Bortniczak, both 18, and Jordanna Goodwin, Megan Storey, and Blake Cairns, all 16, died in the crash in South Yorkshire.
Their car collided head-on with another vehicle on the A630 near Conisbrough on 15 November, 2014.
Doncaster coroner Nicola Mundy ruled that each of the five teenager's deaths was accidental.
The other car driver was injured.
Jonathan Earp was in a car ahead of the Toyota Corolla at the time of the crash.
Giving evidence at the inquest, he said when he got to the vehicle all the teenagers except his friend Arpad Kore were unconscious.
"He was screaming out in pain and begging me not to leave him," Mr Earp told the court.
He said he was unable to open the car doors and held his friend's hand until the emergency services arrived.
Ms Mundy said she agreed with collision investigators that the most likely cause of the accident was that Mr Bortniczak took his foot off the accelerator as he negotiated a right-hand bend, causing a classic case of "lift-off over-steer".
The car, which had been travelling at about 73mph in a 60mph zone, skidded and was side-on when it hit the Seat.
Tests showed the car would have been able to safely take the bend at that speed if the driver had kept his foot on the accelerator.
Recording her conclusion, Ms Mundy said: "It was the most tragic of accidents. Five young people, who had their lives ahead of them, losing their lives in these circumstances.
"I do not think there were any signs of recklessness. It was a mistake and a high price was paid for it."
The crash happened after the five friends met up with two others - Ben York and Jonathan Earp - who were in a Vauxhall Corsa.
The court heard there had been an investigation into whether the cars had been racing after one witness, Michael Staton, said he had seen two unidentified vehicles at traffic lights revving their engines and then "set off like a dragster start".
Mr York, the driver of the Corsa, was arrested on suspicion of causing death by da

===Input Doc/Src: The Glasgow number 10 has played just 12 minutes of the championship, coming off the bench in the defeat by Wales.
But in the absence of the injured Finn Russell, he has been preferred to Peter Horne, who impressed against France.
"It's tough on him not being selected but it's an opportunity for me," said Weir, who wins his 23rd cap in Dublin.
"The coaches have given me confidence this week. They have watched my Glasgow footage and are happy where I am and my development over the last month or so.
"I feel confident in my game at the minute and just need to back it up come Saturday.
"It is a huge honour getting back into the side. I have been here training, so I know the calls and structures, so it is not being thrown in to the deep end as I have been here throughout the championship."
With Russell still going through concussion return-to-play protocols after receiving a head knock five minutes into the France game, Cotter had the option of continuing with Horne - who he called "probably a 12-10 rather than a 10-12" - after he stepped into the fray with aplomb.
"I was just hugely proud of his performance," Weir said of his Glasgow team-mate. "A guy who has not run a rep pretty much the whole tournament at 10 steps up and shows how natural a ball player he is.
"It was great for me to go on and see him run the attack. Being a playmaker at 12, he is always chatting and orchestrating play anyway."
Having played second fiddle to Russell at club level as well as with the national team, being left out of the match-day 23 for the last two Tests against Italy and France has allowed Weir more game time with Glasgow.
He duly delivered two Pro 12 man-of-the-match displays against Newport Gwent Dragons and Cardiff Blues.
"I have been getting a run of games so I feel confident in my form," he added. "Moving onto the ball you have to make better decisions when you have a run of games going. I feel really excited about the opportunity."

===Input Doc/Src: Increasingly services are springing up offering quick fixes for the annoyance of cracked screens or broken home buttons.
New entrant, iCracked, is hoping its model of sending technicians to customers, sometimes within an hour, will help it win market share.
But critics questioned what impact it would have.
The firm already operates in 250 US cities and as the name suggests, focuses mainly on iOS devices but also repairs some Samsung models.
The prices it will charge for fixing devices will vary but will average about £57, according to the firm.
"For most people, their phone is an extension of themselves, so when it breaks it can have a huge impact on the way they go about their everyday lives," said founder A J Forsythe.
The firm began life in 2010 at a US university where Mr Forsythe was a student.
"I started handing out flyers around campus and people would call me and I'd fix their device," he told the BBC.
Growth came fast and the firm now employs 1,000 technicians across the US.
Its UK launch will initially be focused in London with 30 technicians which it hopes to expand to 100 next year.
Customers can call out a fixer either via the iCracked website or its app. They then arrange a time for them to come to their home, office or local coffee shop to repair the device.
There is a burgeoning industry springing up around smartphone repairs. High street shops offer drop-in services where they can repair phones or tablets in a matter of hours, often more cheaply than iCracked.
Websites such as Quick Fix Mobile also offer repairs within 24 hours, with prices averaging £30 - £50 for a broken screen.
Marketing manager Sean Barber was dismissive of iCracked.
"I'm not sure why these big companies come from the US and make such big news. There are already plenty of others in the UK already offering this service."
He compared iCracked's launch with that of Uber, the lift-sharing service which has proved controversial to the taxi industry.

===Input Doc/Src: Thomas Gallagher, 16, was discovered by a member of the public in Old Kays Park in Tottington, Bury, in July 2015.
An inquest concluded the schoolboy took his own life and police shortcomings did not contribute to his death.
But an Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) report found Greater Manchester Police's (GMP) conduct was "below the standard expected."
The teenager's parents criticised police, saying there had been serious failings in the handling of the case, the Manchester Evening News reports.
In a statement they said: "We explained his vulnerabilities concerning his recent mental health history. Subsequently two members of the public found Tom five hours later. GMP failed to respond at all."
The IPCC found police delayed looking for the schoolboy because of staffing shortages in the Bury division, which were "foreseeable".
"No officers were deployed...until the discovery of Thomas' body some five hours later," the investigator found.
The report said the response of four officers and a radio operator was "unsatisfactory".
It said the conduct of an inspector, a police sergeant, an acting police sergeant, a police constable and a civilian radio operator, "whilst not amounting to misconduct, did fall below the standard expected."
IPCC Associate Commissioner, Guido Liguori, recommended GMP "should address" the "under-resourcing" of the police division in Bury as well as "ensuring police officers and staff are properly supported" for "the benefit of the local community."
Ch Supt Chris Sykes from GMP's Bury division said: "Thomas Gallagher's death was a tragedy and our deepest condolences remain with his family.
"Unfortunately, it was not possible for GMP to resource the original missing report, due to staff abstractions and a higher than usual number of incidents on the night."

===Input Doc/Src: Bees debutant Marco Djuricin had given his side the lead when he found the net with a curling strike.
And the Austria international almost doubled his tally after the break when his first-time shot clipped the post.
But, after Chris Wood saw his attempt turned onto the woodwork at the other end, substitute Antenucci dispossessed Ryan Woods before firing in to level.
Leeds have now scored just twice against Brentford in five matches, having failed to win any of the games dating back to the 2009-10 season.
Media playback is not supported on this device
The visitors took the lead when Djuricin, who joined on loan from Red Bull Salzburg on 31 August, found the net midway through the first half.
Jake Bidwell then went close to doubling the lead when his second-half header bounced across goal, before another Djuricic attempt hit the post.
Leeds striker Wood also saw a deflected effort hit the woodwork, when his shot was turned onto the post by Bees goalkeeper David Button.
But, just when it looked like it might turn out to be a first defeat of the season for the hosts, Brentford's debutant substitute Woods - who had only been on the pitch for two minutes - was easily dispossessed by Antenucci and the Italian, who had come on at half-time, fired home the equaliser into the corner with his left foot.
The result means Leeds remain unbeaten this season, having drawn five of their six opening games in the Championship.
Leeds manager Uwe Rosler:
"We lost our fearlessness and we made a mistake. When you do that against Brentford they can find the holes.
"Then we were down on confidence and they scored. We looked like we were afraid to get on the ball, that can happen. We deserved to trail at half-time.
"In the second half we started 0-0 and the substitutes helped us. The last 25-30 minutes we battered them in a football sense and could have won the game. I think it was a fair result for two teams who wanted to win."
---Sum/Tgt: Mirco Antenucci's second-half strike saw Uwe Rosler's Leeds rescue a point against his old club Brentford.

===Input Doc/Src: Matthew Daley, 34, of Worthing, is being held on suspicion of murdering Don Lock, 79,  and police have until midnight to charge or release him.
Mr Lock died from stab wounds after a suspected road-rage confrontation near Findon, which Sussex Police described as an "unprovoked attack".
On Saturday a knife was recovered and sent for tests.
His family gave an emotional news conference on the same day to pay tribute to the man they described as "gentle, kind and loving".
Mr Lock's son, Andrew, said the family had been "incredibly overwhelmed" by messages of support and they were "deeply grateful" to the people who had tried to treat Mr Lock at the side of the road.

He was attacked after getting out of his car following a crash with another vehicle on the A24 on Thursday evening.
Paramedics were called but he died at the scene.
On Saturday Det Ch Insp Paul Rymarz said Mr Lock was the victim of a "violent, unprovoked attack that he had no chance to defend himself against".

===Input Doc/Src: Alpha Foxtrot, affectionately known as Foxy, was the last of the fleet to fly when the jet was withdrawn from service in 2003, and displaying it at the airfield was only ever a temporary solution.
Concorde enthusiasts are keen to see the aircraft indoors, protected from the elements, and back on display as soon as possible.
But the decision rests with Airbus and British Airways (BA) who are currently considering two separate business plans for museums to house the jet.
So how vital is it to get a roof over the plane?
Ben Lord, chairman of the Save Concorde Group, which submitted its plan for a museum in June 2011, said he was expecting a decision "any day".
The group would like to see Foxy fly again in the future, but Mr Lord said this could only happen if the aircraft was looked after indoors.
"Obviously the long-term thinking is if it's indoors, nice and dry, where engineers can get easier access, ultimately that enhances the prospect of it flying again," he said.
"But the aircraft is still exposed to the elements. Largely it's causing corrosion issues. People could argue that it was outside all the time when it was in service, but when it's flying the outside skin heats up to 127C so it was keeping it dry.
"Being exposed to harsh winters and rainy conditions isn't good for it.
"The shameful part of it all is it will be nine years in November. By now it should be under cover."
The Concorde Trust has been working on plans for an indoor museum for some years, but hit a snag in May last year when their bid for £2.9m from the Heritage lottery Fund was turned down.
The trust has since submitted revised plans.
Project director Lloyd Burnell said the trust was working with the Bristol Aero Collection (BAC) on plans for a museum.
"It needs to be undercover for the preservation of the aircraft. Aircraft are not designed to sit around," he said.
Another reason they want it indoors is so the museum can also display the BAC - exhibits charting 100 years of the city's aviation

Security forces at the scene say the gunmen are now holding hostages.
Security in Kabul has deteriorated significantly throughout 2016.
The three gunmen began their assault early on Wednesday evening, with at least one of the attackers reported by Tolo News to have detonated explosives inside.
It reported that also among the dead were the 25-year-old son of Kandahar MP Obaidullah Barikzai and two security force members.
A number of people are reported to have been wounded including a former police chief. Gunfire and explosions were recently reported to have been heard at the premises in the west of the city.

Relatives and friends of Mr Wali - who is reported to have escaped the attackers through the house of a neighbour - are believed to be among the hostages.
The Taliban in a statement said suicide bombers attacked the house because it was hosting an "important gathering of security officials".
The attack again exposes continuing instability in Afghanistan, with regular strikes by suicide bombers and gunmen in recent months in Helmand and in Kabul. The city has been targeted repeatedly by the militants throughout this year.
Police special forces have now been deployed at the scene, officials say, and their priority is to evacuate people from the house and surrounding areas.

===Input Doc/Src: It was widely anticipated the Spending Review would confirm the need for police efficiencies would remain at the top of the agenda, at least until 2020.
The Home Office is not one of the favoured "protected" ministries shielded from cuts.
And as 71% of its gross spending goes on crime and policing, that is where most of the department's cuts have bitten.
Add to that Home Secretary Theresa May's determination to reform policing, and there was a strong sense the government would not change course.
That was certainly the expectation at Manchester Town Hall, where chief constables and police and crime commissioners (PCCs) had gathered for their annual joint conference.
At 12:30, a large group of them took their places around a television set in a room set aside for exhibitors to watch the chancellor's statement. The mood was sombre. Most chiefs and PCCs had been planning for cuts of 20-25%.
The Inspectorate of Constabulary had suggested that by 2018, forces would have to shed at least 12,000 officer, staff and police community support officer (PCSO) posts, with further reductions after that.
The inspectorate, known for its careful, measured commentary, warned some forces might not be able to withstand another round of cuts, because they were not efficient enough. It said the "operational viability" of some could be "in jeopardy".
The National Police Chiefs Council, which co-ordinates the work of forces, feared the job losses would be even worse - 35,000 by 2020, which, Sara Thornton, who chairs the council, said in July, would be a "game changer".
Constabularies with large urban areas stood to lose the most, as they tend to rely more on Home Office funding, among them Northumbria, which gets 85% of its income from central government, and the West Midlands, 83%.
So, when the announcement came, towards the end of Mr Osborne's statement, that there would be no further policing cuts, there was genuine disbelief, mixed with delight.

===Input Doc/Src: Asking prices in the capital for these top-of-the-ladder properties fell by 8.7% over the past year, according to search site Rightmove. House prices grew much faster in eastern England and the West Midlands than in London, according to Zoopla.
London's annual house price growth for 2016 (3.7%) was below the UK average of 4.5% for the first time since 2008, the Nationwide Building Society says.
So has the London bubble burst? Are bargains to be had? Well, these things are relative.
One new development in Radstock Street in Battersea will see eight large apartments go on the market in February for £3.65m each.
For most people around the UK, that is an eye-watering price for a three-bedroom property. Yet, the developers say these homes will be attractive to downsizers - people aged in their 50s and 60s already owning a home in central London.
The idea of downsizing to a £3m-plus home might make those eyes water a little more, but Louisa Brodie, head of search at Banda Property, says these apartments are "realistically priced".
"They have car parking, a porter, and are brand new. Properties like this are rare to find, and areas like this have a unique selling point," she says. "London is still one of the most desirable places to live, anywhere."
This is surely a sign that London property has been decoupled from the rest of the country for many years.
Despite the drop in activity in London, the average house price in the capital is still £474,000, more than double the typical price of £217,000 in the UK as a whole, according to the latest official figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
The slowdown in central London is the result of the most significant change in the housing market in 2016 - a stamp duty surcharge on buy-to-let and second homes.
Since April, anyone buying a home that is not their main residence has had to pay a 3% stamp duty surcharge. This meant that, for second homes or buy-to-let properties, the rate for properties priced at more than

===Input Doc/Src: In a thinly veiled attack on president Sepp Blatter's leadership, Michael Garcia reiterated the need for "greater transparency".
"The investigation and adjudication process operates in most parts unseen and unheard," continued Garcia.
He added that the organisation needs a "leadership that sends a message that the rules apply to everyone".
Talking about the current investigation process, Garcia said: "That's a kind of system which might be appropriate for an intelligence agency but not for an ethics compliance process in an international sports institution that serves the public and is the subject of intense public scrutiny."
American lawyer Garcia concluded his lengthy investigation into the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bidding process last month and handed his report to Fifa's ethics adjudicator Hans Joachim Eckert, but he is disappointed by the world governing body's insistence on keeping his report confidential.
In a keynote speech at an event organised by the American Bar Association in London, Garcia added: "The natural next step of the development of an effective ethics process at Fifa is greater transparency.
"The second element that is vital to fulfilling the promise of this reform process is tone at the top.
"More simply put, the second element an institution like Fifa needs in order to meet the challenge of ethics enforcement is leadership. An ethics committee - even a serious, independent ethics committee backed by a strong code of ethics - is not a silver bullet.
"What is required is leadership that sends a message that the rules apply to everyone; leadership that wants to understand and learn from any mistakes or mis-steps the ethics committee may have identified; leadership that makes it clear to everyone - this is what we've set up the ethics committee to do, this is why they do it, and this is what they've done.

===Input Doc/Src: Researchers at St Andrews University said a method using a small circular hole could have wide implications for 3D technology.
The study, published in Psychological Science, also has implications for people who have just one eye or difficulties with double-eye vision.
The method was said to create 3D similar to effects used in film-making.
Researchers said that current thinking was based on the need for two visual images - one from each eye - to be combined in the visual cortex, creating a sense of depth.
But Dr Dhanraj Vishwanath, a psychologist at the university, believes both eyes are not necessary for this "3D experience".
Dr Vishwanath said: "We have demonstrated experimentally, for the first time, that the same 'special way' in which depth is experienced in 3D movies can also be experienced by looking at a normal picture with one eye viewing through a small aperture (circular hole).
"While this effect has been known for a long time, it is usually dismissed.
"Now we have shown that it is in fact real, and the perceptual results are exactly like stereoscopic 3D, the kind seen in 3D movies.
"Based on this finding, we have provided a new hypothesis of what the actual cause of the 3D experience might be."
The university said the 1838 invention of the stereoscope - the technology behind 3D film-making - brought with it the assumption two eyes were necessary for 3D vision.
Dr Vishwanath said: "This work has significant implications for people who don't have normal binocular vision.
"First it could help them experience what it means to see in 3D. Second, it could encourage them to seek therapy to try to regain two-eye 3D vision (which produces the strongest 3D effect in everyday life) once they can see first-hand what 'seeing in 3D' is really like."
Dr Vishwanath and his colleagues are now testing the method with a large group of strabismics, people with misaligned eyes.

===Input Doc/Src: His firm, Cameron Pace Group and its Chinese partners will develop advanced equipment for 3D filming.
The move comes amid a boom in China's movie industry and a growing demand for 3D films in the country.
Various Hollywood filmmakers have been trying to tap into the Chinese market.
"The future of entertainment is 3D and we believe that the future of 3D is right here in China," Mr Cameron was quoted as saying by the Associated Press news agency.
Earlier this year, Chinese authorities had announced that they will allow an additional 14 foreign films to be shown in the country, if the movies are made in 3D or for the big-screen Imax format.
China's movie industry has seen robust growth in the past few years.
Ticket sales in the world's second-largest economy surged 29% to 13.1bn yuan ($2.1bn; Â£1.3bn) in 2011. They are forecast to rise further, by around 20% in the current year.
The growth in its market has seen various Hollywood filmmakers and studios announcing joint ventures with Chinese firms.
Earlier this week, Dreamworks Animation announced plans to co-produce the next Kung Fu Panda movie with its Chinese partners. The firm said it was also planning to open an entertainment district in the country.
In April, Walt Disney Company, the world's largest entertainment firm, said that it plans to co-produce Iron Man 3 with Beijing-based DMG Entertainment.

===Input Doc/Src: A win over Motherwell was not enough and Foran, who wants to stay on as manager, felt let down by some players.
The manager made reference to "two or three bad apples in the dressing room".
And he added: "I probably should have got rid of them in January. I stayed loyal to a lot of players and some of them didn't pay me back."
Inverness won three of their last four Premiership matches as they fought to finish in the play-off spot.
But Hamilton Accies' 4-0 hammering of Dundee on Saturday ensured they will face Dundee United for a spot in the Premiership next term, while Inverness will play Championship football despite their 3-2 win over Well.
"It's obviously disappointment," Foran added. "The best clubs in the world get knocked down, it's how you rebuild and come back. I've told the players there are far worse off people in life.
"But it happens in football. It is not all rosy. It is not all about winning all the time. I've been part of relegation teams - you stay loyal, you rebuild. You get knocked down, you get back up again.
"You need to get rid of the two or three players you don't want, that haven't given 100%, and I look forward to getting rid of those three.
"Of the starting 11 today, I would hope to have at least 10 of those for next season [midfielder Greg Tansey is leaving to join Aberdeen]. I am very proud of the players and when we got the right team playing, we could finish well, with guys giving their all for the club."
Foran, who was a player at the time, stayed with Inverness when they were relegated from the top flight in 2009.
One year into a four-year contract, he hopes to do the same as manager.
"I want to be here next season," he said. "I will have a chat with the board probably on Monday or Tuesday and will find out what their thoughts are. But I am 100% behind this club and I expect to be here next season.
"There are changes to be made, on and off the field. Personally I want a smaller squad.

===Input Doc/Src: The club are close to appointing the former Ajax and Inter Milan boss, 47, to succeed Sam Allardyce, who led Palace to 14th in the Premier League in May following a relegation battle.
"The Champions League is not realistic but with good organisation you can stay in the middle," De Boer said.
"With a great season, maybe you could sneak European football."
Between 2010 and 2016, De Boer coached Ajax, winning the Eredivisie for four consecutive seasons between 2011 and 2015.
But the former Netherlands international has been out of work since he was sacked by Inter Milan in November 2016 after only 85 days in charge.
"It's always been one of his desires to come to the Premier League," added Ronald.
"It's the biggest league in the world - not necessarily the best - but the most exciting for sure. Frank wants to be part of that and hopefully he gets that opportunity with Crystal Palace.
"As it stands now, I know that both sides want to go with each other but there are just little things to discuss."
De Boer was appointed as Inter boss two weeks before the start of the 2015-16 season after Roberto Mancini left by mutual consent.
He had never previously coached or played in Italy and led Inter to just four league wins in his opening 11 games, leaving them 12th in the Serie A table.
"Falling down on your face sometimes helps you to move forward," said his brother.
"It's so difficult to step into a team who are not at all fit and have an average age of 28, just two weeks before the start of the season. It is very difficult to change the philosophy.
"But he learned he needs a good pre-season to get a proper idea of what his squad is about.
"He is more than capable of doing well with any team and also with Crystal Palace if he decides to sign with them."
---Sum/Tgt: Frank de Boer could help Crystal Palace to the Europa League if he takes charge at Selhurst Park, says brother Ronald.

===Input Doc/Src: Ann Barnes dealt with an "ill-advised" TV documentary, a probe into her car insurance, and youth commissioners who both had to step away from their role.
But she said she judged her time as PCC as a success.
She said Kent Police was now target-free, provided quality service and put victims at the heart of its work.
"Apart from one or two things I'd rather not have happened, I've really, really had a good time," she said.
Referring to incidents that led to adverse headlines, she said: "You have to accept what life throws at you and deal with it."
Mrs Barnes, who is not standing for re-election, said the Kent force was recognised nationally after latest HMIC reports.
"[Kent Police] genuinely puts victims at the heart of what it does. There are no targets, people don't chase targets. They just look to do a quality service," she said.
On her youth commissioner appointments, Mrs Barnes said: "You can't interview for the unexpected."
Kent's first youth commissioner Paris Brown resigned over comments she had posted on Twitter, and Kerry Boyd had to stop public engagements while reports of a relationship were investigated.
Mrs Barnes said Ms Brown handled things well after making mistakes when younger, and Ms Boyd did a good job and could have continued but turned down an extended contract.
After Ms Boyd left, the youth commissioner was not replaced.
Mrs Barnes said she was most proud of Kent Police's "open and transparent" culture.
And she said a new victim centre was providing "a wraparound service" to victims and witnesses, and she believed it would become a blueprint for delivering victims' services.
Voting for Kent's next PCC will take place on 5 May, with six candidates standing.
---Sum/Tgt: Kent's outgoing high-profile police and crime commissioner (PCC) has said she is proud of her achievements four years after being elected.

===Input Doc/Src: Thousands upon thousands of local council jobs look like getting the axe due to the spending squeeze, yet 270 jobs rolling steel slabs get a task force, all hands are on deck to find a buyer, while the opposition calls for nationalisation.
It's not hard to see why. Nostalgia is part of it, these being the remnants of a once great and noble industry, around which large parts of Lanarkshire was built.
It's partly because Clydebridge and Dalzell are symbolic of the impact of globalisation, forcing transition on workers and communities at a local level as the price of enriching the broader economy.
Other parts of Britain and Europe feel the strain of in-migrating people. In Motherwell and Cambuslang, the concern is about out-migrating jobs.
But it's also because there's discomfort that the new economy and the new labour market is unplanned and haphazard, buffeted by market forces and lacking in the security of big plants with jobs-for-life.
It is not always easy to appreciate that Britain has grown quite successfully in recent years by retreating from the making of things.
The service sector makes up 75% of the economy, and while it ranges from high-value finance and professional roles to burger-flipping and care homes, it lacks that noble quality with which the old heavy (and dirty) industries are seen in hindsight.
There is widespread agreement that Britain needs to think again about manufacturing. On the freer market end of things, George Osborne coined the evocative ambition for there to be a "march of the makers".
The rhetoric hasn't always matched the policy outcomes. Industrial policy at Westminster now consists of a push towards a more technically literate workforce, and incentives aimed at 11 chosen sectors, ranging across aerospace and automotive to nuclear and wind power, life sciences and professional and business services.
There are also 'catapult centres' for propelling ideas towards the market in robotics, synthetic biology and better batteries.

===Input Doc/Src: The televised event in Miami took place just days before the next round of primaries, including Florida.
With 246 delegates at stake, the southern state is the biggest prize.
Mr Sanders had a surprise victory in Michigan on Tuesday, but Hillary Clinton increased her overall lead with a big win in Mississippi.
In the Republican race on the same day, Donald Trump won three more states (Michigan, Mississippi and Hawaii) in his bid to win the Republican nomination. Ted Cruz won a Republican-only race in Idaho.
The states were the latest to choose candidates to compete in November's presidential election.

US media: Has Sanders changed Democratic race?
What will Americans do if Trump wins?
Election results - as they come in
During the Miami debate, former Secretary of State Mrs Clinton criticised Vermont Senator Mr Sanders for voting against an immigration reform back in 2007.
"Just think, imagine where we would be today if we had achieved comprehensive immigration reform nine years ago," she said.
Mr Sanders responded by saying he had concerns about the treatment of guest workers. The proposed programme was "akin to slavery", he said.
He also said that Mrs Clinton was against allowing illegal immigrants to obtain driver's licences.
It's been only three days since their last debate, but all it took for the political fortunes in the Democratic presidential race to change dramatically was one day of voting in Michigan.
Thanks to Bernie Sanders' shocking - albeit narrow - upset win in that state's primary on Tuesday, Hillary Clinton went from exuding confidence on Sunday night in Flint to acknowledging on Wednesday evening in Miami that she's "not a natural politician".
Mr Sanders, with a new lease on political life, went on the attack early against the former secretary of state. He implied that she had something to hide by not releasing transcripts of paid speeches to Wall Street firms and that she is in the pocket of big busine

===Input Doc/Src: Visitors are scouring its pebble beach for fossils and taking photos of the stripes of rock strata embedded in the surrounding cliffs - a visual reminder of millions of years of history.
And they are all asking each other the same question: "What time is it?"
The clocks on our phones have reset themselves to French time, and for the surprising number who are not wearing watches, the confusion is palpable.
Then the phones start beeping. "Welcome to France!" read the incoming text messages. "Your roaming costs are..."
Inadvertent roaming, as it is called, is surprisingly common in this part of the country, despite France itself being a fair distance away - there are 74 miles (119km) between Poole and Cherbourg, a popular ferry route.
Visitors to the surrounding areas, including Portland near Weymouth, can find themselves suddenly connected to French networks, and, if they're not careful, run up their phone bills with every phone call, text and social network update being charged as if it was made from abroad.
It's not only a problem along the south coast of England - residents and visitors along the borders of Northern Ireland face substantial issues with their phones connecting to Irish networks, often without them even realising it.
In 2012 research carried out there by industry regulator Ofcom found that on average those affected were spending Â£300 a year each on accidental data roaming, and only 11% of them had thought to switch the service off on the phone itself.
The worst affected areas were east and north County Londonderry - notably Portstewart, south County Armagh and south County Down.
"The EU Roaming Regulation requires that mobile operators take reasonable steps to protect their customers from paying roaming charges for inadvertently accessed roaming services while situated in their home member state, and to make information available to their customers on how to avoid inadvertent roaming in border regions," said an Ofcom representative.

===Input Doc/Src: The Scottish writer posted a message on his official website saying his next novel The Quarry, due to be published later this year, would be his last.
The 59-year-old's novels include The Wasp Factory, The Crow Road, Complicity and the Culture series.
The statement said his health problems came to light when he saw his doctor, suffering from a sore back.
He was diagnosed with jaundice, before further tests established the full extent of his illness.
In the personal statement on his website, Banks said he had asked his partner Adele to marry him and was now on a short honeymoon.
Banks' first novel The Wasp Factory was published in 1984 and introduced the Fife-born writer as  a dark new force in British literature.
Described in turn as "macabre... bizarre... and depraved," the book was included in a 1997 poll of the 20th Century's top 100 books, placed higher than Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men.
Subsequent novels, including Espedair Street and The Crow Road, were adapted for radio and television and his 1993 book Complicity was made into a film in 2000, starring Trainspotting's Jonny Lee Miller.
Considered one of Scotland's foremost writers, most of whose books are set in his home country, the writer ventures further afield in his parallel career as a writer of science fiction under the guise of Iain M Banks.
Using his middle name of Menzies - on the advice of his publisher who said it looked "more American" for a US market - several of Banks' sci-fi works are set in the Culture universe, a semi-anarchist utopia.
His most recent work in the so-called Culture series - The Hydrogen Sonata - was released last year. In its review - the Independent praised Banks' "taste for the absurd".
Fellow Scottish author, Ian Rankin, said the news of Banks' terminal cancer was "just awful".
He Tweeted: "Typical of Iain to propose marriage to his partner Adele with the words 'Will you do me the honour of becoming my widow?"

===Input Doc/Src: Comic Enterprises successfully argued in the High Court that 20th Century Fox's show breached its trademark right to The Glee Club name.
The show's broadcaster appealed against the 2014 ruling, but appeal court judges dismissed their case.
It is not yet clear whether the Glee show's name will have to be changed.
The appeal court judges are now due to consider whether EU trademark law affects the ruling and therefore means no change is required.
More updates on this and Birmingham and the Black Country
Part of the film studio's argument was that it should not need to change the name, citing EU law which states a trademark must be "a sign", in the sense of being a single sign and capable of being "graphically represented".  The show's name, it said, did not fall into this category.
As a result, the judges have asked the two parties and the UK Intellectual Property Office to enter their submissions on the issue by Monday when they will consider whether to send the case to the European courts.
The television show first aired in 2009 on the Fox Channel - part of Rupert Murdoch's media empire.
Mark Tughan, owner of the comedy club chain, said he received an 80-page ruling from Lord Justice Lloyd Jones, Lady Justice Arden and Lord Justice Kitchin on Monday following the appeal hearing in November.
Mr Tughan said the comedy club's trademark was registered in 1999 and that he started legal proceedings in 2011.
The film studio is yet to comment on the appeal being thrown out.
Mr Tughan, who tweeted his victory, told BBC News "I feel vindicated, not only for taking the case in the first place but now that two courts have come to the same conclusion about the infringement on my trademark.
"One would hope that Fox would put down their weapons but they have shown no inkling of wanting to settle this."
He added he was awarded some compensation from the High Court hearing but said he is yet to pursue what he feels he is entitled to.

===Input Doc/Src: Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez slotted in the winning spot-kick after Argentina's Gonzalo Higuain fired over and Ever Banega was denied by Claudio Bravo.
Higuain had earlier missed from close range after 90 minutes of few chances.
Sanchez came closest in extra time for Chile, who scored all four of their penalties in the shootout.
Where Chile held their nerve, Argentina wilted in the shootout at the end of a performance that fell well short of the heights they reached in their 6-1 semi-final win over Paraguay.
Le Albiceleste are without a major trophy in the last 22 years since winning the 1993 Copa America in Ecuador.
Chile's victory brought an end to almost a century of competing in the Copa America without claiming a title.
They were one of four teams who played in the very first tournament in 1916 in Argentina but the best they had done until this year was runner-up, which they have achieved on four occasions (1955, 1956, 1979 and 1987).
The Estadio Nacional Julio Martinez Pradanos was a cauldron of noise on Saturday, full of flag-waving red-clad home supporters, some of whom had reportedly paid up to $25,000 for tickets.
They were not treated to a dazzling attacking display from their side but rather one of drive, discipline and, ultimately, composure, epitomised by the industrious and energetic Sanchez and Charles Aranguiz.
Both sides scored their opening penalty, with Matias Fernandez emphatically finding the top corner for Chile before Lionel Messi sent his kick low into the bottom corner.
However, after Arturo Vidal had powerfully dispatched Chile's second, Higuain blazed his effort way over the bar.
Charles Aranguiz made it 3-1 to the hosts and it remained that way as Ever Banega's tame effort was palmed away by the diving Claudio Bravo.
Sanchez showed supreme composure to chip his effort down the middle and in to win the game and the competition for his side.

===Input Doc/Src: Colin Campbell, 56, has primary progressive MS and told BBC Scotland last month that his health had rapidly deteriorated over the last two years.
He has now said he may not attend the Swiss clinic after another MS patient encouraged him to press for more help.
NHS Highland said support was tailored to individual patients' needs.
Assisted suicide is unlawful in Scotland. A move to change the law was defeated in a vote in the Scottish Parliament in 2015.
Mr Campbell, who is booked to go to a clinic in Basel next month, was first diagnosed with MS when he was 34, but had previously suspected he had a health condition because of a deterioration in his ability to play sports.
He told the BBC: "How people should be looking at this is 'Colin is worn out with having had this incredible progressive illness'.
"'His death will give him release.'"
Mr Campbell uses a walking frame to move around his flat and a wheelchair when travelling outside his home.
He formerly worked in IT, still has use of his hands and plays the guitar.
However, he fears he will reach a point where he can no longer use his hands and will be unable to feed himself.
Since expressing his intention to end his life, Mr Campbell has been contacted by fellow MS patient Rona Tynan.
She has offered to help him seek appropriate help to improve his quality of life.
She said: "It was extremely important that I made contact with Colin and I'm so glad I saw him on the television.
"What alarmed me about Colin was, I felt he was more able than myself.
"I was very, very concerned that he'd made his decision when it was maybe horrible weather. The winters are long when you've got MS."
Among the practical measures Ms Tynan has helped Mr Campbell with has been a test drive on a mobility scooter.
It is one of the things he said had prompted him to look again at his plans.
He said: "This has given me some kind of optimism which I definitely didn't have - so I owe that to Rona.

===Input Doc/Src: The bag rocks alarmingly from side-to-side and threatens to overturn.
Now, scientists have investigated this conundrum of everyday physics. Speeding up rather than slowing down can solve the problem, they say.
Alternatively, you can pivot the handle of the suitcase as close to the ground as possible.
French scientists studied a model suitcase on a treadmill to see what goes wrong when a suitcase rocks out of control at high speed.  They developed equations to explain why two-wheeled trolleys have a tendency to rock from one wheel to the other.
In cases of unstable bags - after having gone over a bump, for example - they found luggage rocks from side-to-side until it falls over, or it reaches a regular side-to-side swing.
If a regular side-to-side swing develops, going faster results in smaller swings, said the researchers.
"Thus, one should accelerate rather than decelerate to attenuate the amplitude of oscillations," they explained.
"A non-experienced suitcase puller would not react this way. The outcome should not be a dramatic for a suitcase, but it could be troublesome for a trailer towed by a vehicle."
This leads on to important practical implications of the research, which is published in the journal HRoyal Society Proceedings A.
"The suitcase is a fun way to tackle the problem but the study would be the same for any trolley with two wheels or blades," Sylvain Courrech du Pont, of Universite Paris-Diderot, who led the study, told BBC News.
"So it will be the same for a caravan or maybe also for airplanes."
In technical terms, the mechanical instability is mainly due to the fact that there is a coupling between the translational motion and the rotational motion of the suitcase.
It comes about because the two wheels are fixed together on a rod.
In April, scientists solved another problem of everyday physics - why shoe laces come undone.
They found the force of a foot striking the ground stretches and then relaxes the knot, while a second force caused by the leg

===Input Doc/Src: The Taliban attacked from the mountains as the convoy was travelling through Laghman valley, officials say, and at least 22 insurgents were also killed.
The Sar-e-Pol provincial governor said that a number of security force vehicles were destroyed.
Earlier a civilian was killed in a suicide bomb attack in Kabul.
Villagers also accused Nato of killing seven civilians, including a nine-year-old child, in an air strike in eastern Paktia province.
They were the first people reported killed in air strikes since the new government was installed at the end of September.
However, Nato said Sunday's strike had killed "eight armed enemy combatants".
The issue of Nato air strikes was the most contentious of the many disputes that former President Hamid Karzai had with the international community, reports the BBC's David Loyn in Kabul.
The violence comes ahead of the withdrawal of most foreign troops from Afghanistan by the end of the year, with Afghan security forces increasingly taking over from Nato-led forces in the fight against the militants.
Officials say that at least seven security force members were wounded in the Sar-e-Pol ambush.
Correspondents say that the early morning attack highlights Afghanistan's fragile security structure as Nato withdraws all of its combat troops.
The ambush took place as security forces were travelling to reinforce colleagues in another district of Sar-e-Pol, officials say.
"They called for foreign forces' air support, but they arrived very late," provincial governor Abdul Jabar Haqbin told the AFP news agency.
He said the attack triggered a gun battle that lasted several hours.

===Input Doc/Src: Kristin Forbes, a US academic, was the only member of the Monetary Policy Committee to vote to raise rates this month.
This was the first split between policymakers on rates since last July.
"Monetary policy should not go on hold," Ms Forbes wrote in an opinion piece in the Daily Telegraph.
Ms Forbes, who is due to leave the Bank in June, said raising rates would lessen the risk of above-target inflation, and boost an improved outlook for unemployment and UK output.
Official data on Wednesday showed UK pay growth, adjusted for inflation, halved to just 0.7% - the lowest since October 2014.
But Ms Forbes said that recent weakness in wages growth probably reflects temporary caution about Brexit among employers.
The majority of MPC members saw signs of slowing consumer spending as one reason for caution on interest rates, but Ms Forbes said this should be seen in the context of strong levels of consumption in recent months.
"This softening ... should only be moderate, due to support from resilient consumer confidence, solid house prices, low unemployment, and easy access to cheap credit," she said.
"There are risks consumers could pull back more sharply - but these are still just risks."
Although the UK economy faces a long list of risks including slowing growth, she said these "will continue for years" and should not deter policymakers from making "nimble" decisions.

Rams keeper Scott Carson denied Grigg when he was put through, while Derby rarely troubled Wigan before the break.
Jussi Jaaskelainen kept out Tom Ince's free-kick to ensure a point for Wigan.
The draw extends Derby's unbeaten run to 10 matches, but leaves them seventh in the table and a point adrift of the play-off places, while Wigan are six points clear of Rotherham at the bottom.
Second-from-bottom Wigan, a side beaten just once in the league in seven previous trips to Derby, dating back to 1984, started strongly against Steve McClaren's Rams, with Michael Jacobs testing Carson soon after Grigg and Buxton went close.
Grigg remained the focal point of the Latics' attack, with Yanic Wildschut's cross for the striker forcing Derby's defence to scramble before the Northern Ireland international had the best chance of the match, bursting clear on the counter only to be foiled by Carson.
Before Ince tested Jaaskelainen with a free-kick after 65 minutes, Derby's brightest moment came courtesy of Ikechi Anya in the first-half, with the winger's run teeing up Johnny Russell for a shot that blazed over the bar.
Derby County manager Steve McLaren: "Scott Carson made some great saves to keep us in the game.
"I was pleased to go in 0-0 at half-time but we addressed that and didn't have any problems in the second half, apart from breaking them down and getting the all-important goal.
"We haven't scored enough goals and we are going to get more games like this where we need to break teams down, so we need individuals and that little bit of magic.
"We need more match winners and I believe we have them but the halfway report is are we scoring enough goals? No, we're not."
Wigan manager Warren Joyce: "They (the players) have a lot of pride in themselves and the club and want to do the best for the fans so every credit to the player

===Input Doc/Src: The Rwanda Utilities Regulatory Agency (Rura) said it had received complaints from the public of incitement, hatred, revisionism and genocide denial.
At least 800,000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus died in the genocide.
The BBC has denied that any part of the programme constitutes a "denial of the genocide against the Tutsi".
On Wednesday, Rwandan MPs approved a resolution calling on the government to ban the BBC and to charge the documentary-makers with genocide denial, which is a crime in the country.
Those killed in the genocide are generally believed to be mostly members of the minority ethnic Tutsi group, and Hutus opposed to the mass slaughter.
The BBC programme Rwanda, The Untold Story, includes interviews with US-based researchers who say most of those killed may have been Hutus, killed by members of the then-rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), which has been in power since 1994.
The programme also included interviews with former aides of RPF leader President Paul Kagame, accusing him of plotting to shoot down the presidential plane - the act seen as triggering the slaughter.
He has consistently denied previous such accusations.
Rura said it had established a commission of inquiry to investigate the allegations it had received about the programme, after which further action may be taken.
The cabinet is meeting next week to discuss parliament's recommendations.
The BBC broadcasts affected by the suspension are produced by the BBC Great Lakes service, which was initially set up in the aftermath of the genocide as a lifeline service.
Its first broadcast - BBC Gahuzamiryango, meaning "the unifier of families" - was a 15-minute transmission aimed at bringing together families who had been separated.
---Sum/Tgt: Rwanda has suspended BBC broadcasts in the Kinyarwanda language with immediate effect because of a film questioning official accounts of the 1994 genocide.

===Input Doc/Src: The retired American, 36, said he felt "exploited" by McGregor's camp.
Malignaggi also reacted angrily on social media to an image that showed him down on the canvas during one of two spars with UFC fighter McGregor.
"This was a push down in sparring, post the whole video, rounds one through 12, unedited," he said.
UFC lightweight title-holder McGregor will make his professional boxing debut when five-weight world champion Mayweather comes out of retirement to face him in Las Vegas on 26 August.
Two-weight world champion Malignaggi had been one of the sparring partners helping to prepare McGregor.
Malignaggi claimed he "beat the breaks off" McGregor during one session, and the Irishman pushed him down out of "frustration".
In a post on Instagram, Malignaggi said he will not give away any of McGregor's tactics but added he will speak about what has "upset" him "in time".
"I came with the best intentions and intended to help out," said Malignaggi.
"It's some of the stuff outside the ring and some ways things were handled in training camp that I didn't agree with and made me come to this decision."
Reacting later to the picture of him on the canvas on Twitter, Malignaggi added: "I came to help this camp out, not to be exploited, now you're going to get the truth."
Retired referee Joe Cortez - who officiated when Mayweather beat Ricky Hatton in 2007 - has been working with the McGregor camp to assist in helping the UFC champion adapt to boxing rules.
Earlier this week, Cortez revealed he had to stop a sparring session between McGregor and Malignaggi because the pair were "out of control".
Prior to joining McGregor's team, Malignaggi told BBC Radio 5 live in May that "not a second" of the 29-year-old's bout with former five-weight world champion Mayweather would be competitive.

The Welsh government and BT are delivering the scheme, Superfast Cymru.
A spokesman said it was a "challenging and ambitious project" and so far 560,000 properties have accessed superfast broadband because of it.
It provides access to fibre broadband for the majority of premises not covered by any commercial roll-out of superfast broadband.
Conservative party member Mr Bebb said: "Superfast Cymru is publicly funded and my experience would indicate that the programme is out of control, and there's a lack of clarity in what it will deliver and how it will deliver."
The Superfast Cymru spokesman said in a project of its size, issues can arise that affect delivery dates.
He added that while this can be "frustrating", more than 80% of properties in Wales can access fibre broadband if they want.

===Input Doc/Src: Four attackers were seen entering the office, followed by heavy gunfire and several explosions.
Five security officers - including a police chief - were among the dead and 26 government officials among the hurt.
A spokesman for the Taliban said they carried out the attack.
The siege ended seven hours after it began and all four gunmen were killed by the Afghan National Security Forces which had surrounded the area.
Police said they rescued the attorney general from his office, which is just 200m (650ft) from the office of the governor of Balkh province.
The governor's aide told the BBC that the governor, Atta Muhammad Nur, was at home when the attack began but was taken to his office to monitor the situation.
In a statement seen by the BBC, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said: "Breaking News: This noon suicide [attackers] stormed office of the attorney and appeal court of Balkh province. Heavy casualties for enemy, battle continues."
The Taliban has targeted Afghanistan's legal system in the past. In June 2013, the group detonated a car bomb in front of the compound of Afghanistan's Supreme Court, killing 17 and wounding 39.
And in December of 2014, Atiqullah Raufi, the chief of the secretariat of Afghanistan's Supreme Court, was assassinated by Taliban gunmen in the west of Kabul.
The attack in Mazar-e-Sharif comes a day after an American soldier was killed in a fire fight between US and Afghan troops in eastern Afghanistan.

Fellow backs Tom Collins, George Furbank, Rory Hutchinson, Sam Olver and Howard Packman have also signed deals.
As have forwards Will Allman, Sion Bennett, James Fish, Lewis Ludlam, Alex Moon, Jordan Onojaife and Josh Peters.
Of the group, England Under-20 wing Collins, 21, is the most experienced in a Saints shirt, having made 27 first-team appearances.

===Input Doc/Src: But this wasn't any ordinary political programme. To investigate what the women of Scotland want from the independence debate - never mind the outcome - we decided to have an all-female cast of contributors.
This wasn't to alienate the good men of Scotland but to ensure we crammed the programme with as many disparate female voices as possible.
The spark for "What Women Want" was a poll by the influential Scottish Social Attitudes Survey that highlighted a sustained gender gap in voting intentions.
Who? Voters in Scotland will go to the polls to vote on their country's future.
What? They will be asked the yes/no question: "Should Scotland be an independent country?"
When? The vote takes place on Thursday, 18 September, 2014.
For as long as the organisation has asked a question about independence - about 15 years - women have been less keen on voting Yes by a consistent six or seven percent margin. Combine that with the disproportionate number of women who say they are undecided, and you have a societal grouping that could prove pivotal for September's outcome.
We wanted to get to the root of why so many women felt unable to make a decision and why, among those who'd professed an opinion, so many felt independence wasn't the road to travel.
It's easy for people like me who've been interviewing politicians on the referendum debate since Adam was a boy to assume every word of it is fed into Scotland's homes to be analysed and debated, but that's clearly nonsense.
Normal people have other priorities, and it could be argued that because so many women have families or are carers, our lives tend to be more fragmented. It's not that we work any harder, let's just say we often have more plates spinning than men.
On the search for women from all walks of life a night at the bingo proved an eye-opener and a humiliation. You would imagine that hearing a number and marking a card is fairly straightforward. It's not. Trailing three numbers behind the caller was a bit disconcerting

Leroy Sterling, 63, of Guns Lane, denies murder and the earlier attempted murder of her lover, Trevor Tyndale, Wolverhampton Crown Court heard.
Pathologists found multiple fractures in her neck, a pattern "commonly found in people strangled," the jury heard.
Mark Haywood QC, prosecuting, told the court Ms Mann's brother became worried when he could not contact her.
He went with his wife to his sister's first floor flat on Chapel Street where they found her body.
More on this and other stories from Birmingham and the Black Country
The prosecution alleges Mr Sterling attempted to murder Mr Tyndale on 11 July 2015 after learning of his ex-partner's relationship.
The two men went drinking at Mr Sterling's flat where the prosecution claims the defendant attacked Mr Tyndale, 52, with a blow to the back of the head.
Mr Sterling continued the attack, "forcing a knife into his neck, trying to choke him", the jury heard.
The prosecution told the court Mr Tyndale managed to escape Mr Sterling's flat and later went to hospital where he had an emergency operation for his injuries.
Mr Tyndale did not inform police about who attacked him fearing his affair would become known to his own wife, Mr Haywood claimed.
The trial continues.

===Input Doc/Src: The Bluebirds could receive up to £5m for the Scotland goalkeeper.
But Giles says the 31-year-old is worth at least £8m, underlining Cardiff's malaise in the Championship.
"They are going to get £3.5m and they're selling him on the cheap. And that tells me where the club is going: nowhere," said Giles.
Marshall agreed personal terms with Hull after being omitted from Saturday's Championship defeat by Reading.
The 31-year-old has made more than 280 appearances for Cardiff since arriving from Norwich City for free in 2009.
Cardiff are 17th in the 24-strong division with one win, two draws and two defeats.
Marshall is widely regarded as their star player and Giles, who had two playing stints with the club lasting a combined total of six years, is unhappy at the player leaving.
"I think it's a joke. Personally I think David Marshall is worth £8m, probably more than that to any club," said Giles before Marshall's move was finalised.
"Football today, I hate it, all these stats - they keep going on with stats, but if you look at Marshall's stats, they would without a doubt be better than anyone in the Championship and be a lot better than goalkeepers in the Premier League and they've let him go.
"Probably if Hull win the Premier League they'll get £5m."
"They are going to get £3.5m and they're selling him on the cheap. And that tells me where the club is going: nowhere."
Giles agrees that Cardiff City need a proven goalscorer, but does not believe one will be signed.
"Without a doubt Cardiff need a striker and talking to fans, they're looking for someone to score 15-20 goals a season," he told Radio Wales Sport.
"Well that's not going to happen this year and unfortunately we're looking at a season where if they finish half way, they've done well.
"Is that going to bring your fans back? You'll always get your diehards going, but is that going to get enthusiastic people coming down to Cardiff City Stadium?

Russell was stretchered off during Glasgow's defeat in Galway after a sickening collision with team-mate Zander Fagerson in the first minute of the match.
The Scotland playmaker was kept in hospital for over a week for observation, but is now back in light training.
"He's working on skills, he's very keen to be involved," Townsend continued.

===Input Doc/Src: The Sky Blues had warned the academy would be under threat if the rugby club got council permission for the facility at the Alan Higgs Centre.
The football club said it was "not against" Wasps having a facility in the city, but was "bitterly disappointed".
Wasps has said the football club could share the proposed centre.
Coventry City, which leases the land from Coventry Sports Foundation (CSF), has said any reduction in hours its youth players could use facilities may diminish the status of its development programme in the eyes of the Football Association.
Football club chairman Tim Fisher said: "Nobody can tell us what will happen with regard to the scheduling or the facilities that accommodate the academy today.
"We've got nine players in and around the first-team group who all came through the academy."
The planning application was approved with conditions, including over parking and roofing materials.
Wasps Group CEO David Armstrong said it understood "sensitivities regarding the location".
He said the football academy had been offered "use of the indoor kicking barn facility on a commercial basis during set periods" and was keen to hold discussions with the club "about how this may work".
Mr Armstrong said it was open to further talks "with CSF and CCFC about any other ways we might be able to assist" with the academy's future.
A council spokesperson said: "In this case the application seeks to use existing sport and leisure facilities for sport and leisure purposes - planning committee can't make its decision on whether this should be rugby or football.
"If the owners of the site that is currently used by the academy wanted to change that use it would be a private matter between the two parties and is not a planning consideration."
CSF has said it repeatedly invited the football club to meet about the academy's future and that the football club chose not to attend a meeting set up with Wasps last month.

Mr Khan said the warnings would help Londoners take "appropriate measures to protect themselves".
Under previous mayor, Boris Johnson, air pollution alerts were available through a subscription text service.
Anyone experiencing discomfort is advised to consider reducing their activity, particularly outdoors.
"This is particularly crucial for Londoners who are vulnerable, such as asthma sufferers," Mr Kahn added.
According to official statistics from the Mayor of London, 9,400 people die from air pollution in London each year.
The alerts are being displayed at 2,500 bus stops and river piers, the entrances of all 270 Tube stations and on 140 signs next to the busiest main roads into London with instructions to switch engines off when stationary to reduce emissions.
The mayor has proposed a series of measures to tackle the problem, including introducing charges for the most polluting vehicles in the Congestion Charge Zone.
King's College London's air quality network describes air pollution in London as "high" due to an area of high pressure over the UK resulting in calm, settled and cold conditions and poor dispersal of local pollutants.
Dr David Green of King's College London said: "Letting people know about the problem is very important.
"The more information, the more action people can take to protect themselves and the more well known the problem the less likely people are to buy that diesel car in the future."

"It's incredible. I thought it would be hard but I've felt good," she said.
"I knew that I am stronger in the sprints, so I was waiting for them to attack on the last climb.

===Input Doc/Src: The first minister has been reflecting on Scottish government proposals for a fresh ballot on the issue in the wake of the general election result.
It saw the SNP lose 21 seats at Westminster after the party's share of the vote fell from 50% to 37%.
But the party's 35 seats meant it remained the largest in Scotland.
The first minister called in March for a second independence referendum to be held in the autumn of next year or spring of 2019, once the results of the Brexit deal are known.
She has insisted a vote was needed to give Scots an alternative to a "hard Brexit" after nearly two-thirds of voters in Scotland backed the UK remaining in the EU.
But she has faced calls from opposition parties to ditch her plans - while some figures from her own party have called on her timetable to be "parked".
Ms Sturgeon discussed a referendum when her cabinet team met in Edinburgh on Tuesday morning.
Her spokesman said afterwards: "There was a discussion led by the first minister on an independence referendum and related issues.
"That forms part of the process she laid out after the election and she will continue to consult with government and party colleagues, and will lay out her views on the way forward in due course."
When asked if this would be before Holyrood breaks up for the summer recess at the close of business on Thursday of next week, he stated: "I think it is likely before then."
The spokesman added there was not "an exact timetable" for when any announcement would be made.
In the immediate aftermath of the general election, Ms Sturgeon conceded her plans for a second independence referendum were "undoubtedly" a factor in the results.
She said at the time: 'We will reflect on these results, we will listen to voters and we will consider very carefully the best way forward for Scotland, a way forward that is in the interests of all of Scotland."

===Input Doc/Src: Several Australian bars have dumped Coopers Brewery after it was featured by religious group the Bible Society.
The video shows two MPs debating their opposing views on same-sex marriage - which is not legal in Australia - as they clutch Coopers beers.
It has led to claims Coopers is against marriage equality, a claim it denies.
The backlash has gathered pace in recent days and, by Tuesday, a string of drinking spots in favour of same-sex marriage had boycotted the brand.
The Bible Society posted the "Keeping It Light" video on Thursday. It features conservative MPs Tim Wilson (for same-sex marriage) and Andrew Hastie (against) debating the issue in what they call a "civil and respectful way".
Coopers has since claimed it "did not give permission" to be included in the video. However, the brand recently celebrated the Bible Society's 200-year anniversary with a commemorative beer featuring Bible verses.
In the video, Mr Wilson argues: "I believe that it would be sensible to change the act that deals with issues around civil marriage to include two people regardless of their gender."
Mr Hastie counters: "I'm for retaining the current definition of marriage, which is between a man and a woman."
Despite Mr Wilson's inclusion, critics interpreted the video as one-sided. One commentator said Coopers risked sponsoring a "political act by a religious organisation", while another said "homophobia lite is still homophobia".
"I have respected Coopers all my life, and it was crushing to realise that as a queer person, they don't respect me," wrote Chloe Sargeant for the Special Broadcasting Service.
Opposition to the video has picked up steam since the weekend. By Tuesday, at least eight drinking spots in Sydney and Melbourne had publicly declared they would not stock Coopers. One widely shared video showed two people throwing full bottles in the bin.

Adrian Thompson, human resources director for Northern Rail, added: "We never rush to dismiss our staff. Dismissal is always a last resort."
The union's general secretary Mick Cash said: "There is no compelling CCTV evidence, the police found no forensic evidence and management could come up with very little in anecdotal evidence to support the decision to dismiss Chad."
Northern Rail said it would continue a normal service this weekend despite the 48-hour strike, which started on Saturday midnight.

===Input Doc/Src: Ouseph, 30, became the first Englishman in 27 years to win the men's singles title with a narrow 21-19 21-19 victory over home favourite Anders Antonsen.
The husband-and-wife Adcocks beat Danes Joachim Fischer Nielsen and Christinna Pedersen in the mixed doubles final.
Scot Kirsty Gilmour lost in the women's singles final to Carolina Martin.
The Spanish top seed triumphed 21-14 21-12.
It is the first time England have won two golds at the Euros since 1988, when Darren Hall won the men's singles and Gillian Clark claimed the mixed doubles title with Danish partner Steen Fladberg.
The success at the Euros comes after GB Badminton had all its funding cut by UK Sport before the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
Ouseph, who had previously won two bronzes and a silver in the men's singles at the European Championships, is just the third Englishman to win the event with Steve Baddeley the previous player to triumph in 1990.
Between the wins for Baddeley and Ouseph, players from Denmark had won gold in eight out of nine European Championships.
The second-seeded Adcocks took full advantage of their first appearance in a Euros final to see off top seeds Nielsen and Pedersen, who had won the event in the past two Championships.
The Adcocks were pegged back after winning the first set but held their nerve to triumph 21-17 18-21 21-19.

===Input Doc/Src: The gunmen had approached the restaurant from Lido beach on Thursday evening, firing on diners.
Twenty people were killed. Militants also detonated two car bombs nearby.
Al-Shabab said it was behind the attack. The group has carried out frequent assaults on the Somali capital.

Lido beach: Sun, surf and... grenades?
Troops then besieged the attackers at the restaurant for eight hours. It was not immediately clear how many of the militants were killed or captured.
The Somali authorities said the leader of the attack had been arrested.
Prime Minister Omar Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke condemned the killings as "barbaric".
There are varying reports about how the attack started but it appears that as the first car bomb went off, at around 19:30 local time (16:30 GMT) on Thursday, the gunmen stormed the area.
"They randomly fired at the people sitting near the beach before entering the restaurant,'' witness Ahmed Nur told Associated Press.
Twenty people were injured in addition to those killed, police said.
After the evening prayer, I went to Lido beach, in particular Beach View restaurant. When I was there about 30 minutes, and I was spending time with my friends including journalists, we saw bullets raining on us.

I saw some people jumping from the second floor. Bullets were flying all over the place, and there was another explosion. Then everyone got confused. I personally saw three wounded people. I did not see those who have been harmed by the explosions. I think the car was parked near the main door of the restaurant.

===Input Doc/Src: Neil Jackson, 35, of Penylan, Cardiff, posed as a landlord online and took £12,840 from nine people but failed to let the three-bedroom home out.
He took deposits before repeatedly cancelling move-in dates claiming his son was battling cancer and had died.
Jackson previously admitted fraud at Cardiff Crown Court.
Andrew Kendall, prosecuting, said Jackson told his victims he needed £1,400 to secure the property and arrange a move-in date only to later claim he could not drop off the keys to Cardiff because his son was ill in Plymouth.
"He'd say things like he blamed nurses for not stitching his son back properly and even told one victim his son had died," he said.
Mr Kendall said the lies had a "great impact" on some victims, with one couple left homeless and another left living in a caravan.
He also pressured one woman into borrowing money from friends and selling possessions so he could "reserve" the home for her.
Mr Kendall said Jackson was eventually found out when some victims found news reports on him being jailed in 2012 for again using his two-year-old son to defraud £60,000.
The former Tesco store manager tricked his workmates for three years, claiming he had cancer and his son had cerebral palsy.
Staff donated money to pay for private treatment but he used it to fund holidays to Las Vegas and Hawaii.
David Pinnell, defending, said Jackson was "genuinely remorseful" and had used the money to pay off debts to people who protected him in prison.
Jailing him for two years, Recorder of Cardiff Eleri Rees, told him: "You have to understand given your track record for elaborate lies the court finds it hard to take what you're saying at face value.
"Some of the victims were in precarious financial situations so the impact on them has been very serious. Others ended up living in a caravan."

===Input Doc/Src: The roadblocks have caused widespread disruption in all Brazilian states.
The Senate is due to vote on the impeachment on Wednesday. A simple majority in favour of a full trial will suspend Ms Rousseff for up to 180 days.
The government has asked the Supreme Court to suspend the impeachment process for alleged irregularities.
However, similar attempts have been rejected by the court.
Protesters blocked the main access roads to Brazil's largest city, Sao Paulo, causing huge traffic jams during the morning rush-hour.
The protests spread to cities and towns across the country.
Police said there were barricades on 14 highways in Brazil's 26 states and the Federal District, home to the capital Brasilia.
In Rio de Janeiro, which will host the Olympics in August and September, protesters set up barricades at a major road linking the city to the state of Sao Paulo.
In the north-eastern city of Natal, buses did not run in the morning and the road next to the main university was blocked. Classes were suspended.
The anti-impeachment protests were organised by a left-wing umbrella organisation, the Popular Brazil Front, which promised to carry on with its direct action tactics.
"We will fight everywhere to defend democracy. Brazil says no to the coup!" it said in a Facebook message.
President Rousseff has vowed to keep fighting until the end against her impeachment.
On Tuesday, the acting Speaker of the lower house of Congress, Waldir Maranhao, surprised the country when he announced that he had suspended the vote that allowed the impeachment process against her to go ahead.
He said the 17 April vote in the lower house had breached Congress rules. Members had voted overwhelmingly in favour of the impeachment process going ahead.
But within less than 24 hours he had revoked his decision to annul the vote. He gave no reason for his u-turn.
If the Senate votes goes ahead on Wednesday and Ms Rousseff loses it, she will be replaced by Vice-President Michel Temer while the trial last

===Input Doc/Src: Not only had there been a tense build-up to the game, given that one of Murray's former coaches, Dani Vallverdu, now works with Berdych, but during the match the Scotsman's fiancee Kim Sears was apparently caught on camera swearing in the opposing camp's direction.
It has all put the spotlight on players' entourages - those close friends and advisers who can be seen sitting in the VIP boxes at big games.
The entourage is the highly motivated family, financial and sporting team driving their man or woman to the top.
As with a rock star or an F1 driver, those behind the scenes form a super-professional and well-drilled team, each with a specific role to play to ensure that the player is as well-prepared and supported as possible - physically, mentally, and financially.
The more cash a player rakes in through prize money and endorsements, the bigger the potential entourage they can employ, with the top stars paying hundreds of thousands of pounds a year on support staff.
The Main Coach
They may not work all year round, but the chief coach is the main sporting point of contact with the player, honing his or her skills to a tournament-ready fine-pitch.
Often, but not always, a former pro themselves who understands the challenges of battling to Grand Slam finals.
They are able to impart the wisdom of their experiences and successes, such as Amelie Mauresmo with Andy Murray, or Boris Becker with Novak Djokovic.
However, Rafael Nadal's coach, his Uncle Toni, was never a top-ranked player, nor was Patrick Mouratoglou, coach of Serena Williams.
The principal coach is often also a defensive shield, and can provide another "public face" to the star.
"Taking an entourage around the world can be incredibly costly," says Simon Chadwick, professor of sports business at Coventry University.
"However, there must be a return on investment because if there was no benefit, particularly given the way these players are so carefully financially managed, then these extensive back-up teams w

===Input Doc/Src: Mr Trump called it a "very precarious" issue for the party and said that Mr Cruz's nomination could be challenged in court.
Mr Cruz was born in Calgary to an American mother and a Cuban father.
Most legal experts believe Mr Cruz meets the requirements to be president.
The Cruz campaign responded by saying Mr Trump had "jumped the shark" - a pop culture reference to when a TV show or fad has overreached and fallen into decline.
The Texas senator is performing well in polling in the early voting state of Iowa. While Mr Trump leads most polls, several surveys show Mr Cruz is the top choice of likely Republican voters.
Much of Mr Trump's support comes from independents, disillusioned Democrats and people who have never voted before.
Some analysts are predicting that Mr Cruz will win because of how the voting process is structured in Iowa.
The caucus format requires more time and dedication from voters than a typical US primary election.
Before Mr Trump became a presidential candidate, the New York businessman had repeatedly questioned President Barack Obama's citizenship.
Mr Obama was born in Hawaii to an American mother and a Kenyan father.
Authorities in Hawaii and Mr Obama both provided detailed birth records after some conservatives such as Mr Trump questioned where he was born.
Mr Obama's allies have said the "birther" movement was a racist effort to discredit the county's first black president.

===Input Doc/Src: Church of the Venerable Bede in West Road, Benwell, closed after a fire extinguisher was used to smash its windows and damage the main hall.
Food bank manager Michael Nixon said about 1,000 families missed getting food parcels due to the vandalism.
He said a glazier firm had offered to fix the damage for free.
Mr Nixon said the project had also received Â£2,500 in donations.
He said: "We are limping along and are in disarray after having to close for a few days, which meant hundreds of families missing out.
"When I saw the damage I felt like I'd been kicked in the stomach.
"But now my faith in humanity has been restored - a glazier firm has offered their services for free and they will come next week to repair our windows."
Mr Nixon said vandals carried out three separate break-ins in a week and were probably looking for cash to steal.
He said they also "mindlessly" smashed up the hall causing Â£2,000 worth of damage.
As well as food parcels, the bank also provides dozens of free, hot meals every day.
The parcels contain enough food for nine meals and are given out to between 40,000 and 50,000 families a year.

===Input Doc/Src: Deiseane Santiago, 22, became pregnant in January while visiting her fiancé in Kegworth on a five-month visa.
Her attempt for a UK visa extension was initially denied and the Home Office said she would have to return.
However, the Home Office said it was now reconsidering her case.
On Thursday morning, Miss Santiago was told she was no longer at immediate risk of deportation.
A Home Office statement said: "We are in contact with Ms Santiago and are reconsidering her case."
A friend of the couple, Susan Cooke, said: "It is a great relief that 'Daisy' is no longer at risk of the Home Office turning up on Friday to remove her.
"However, we are not out of the woods yet. But for the first time this week, things are looking hopeful. This could actually turn into a success story with a healthy baby being born in the UK."
Miss Santiago's fiancé, Simon Ellis, said he feels "scared and trapped".
"All I want is a safe birth for my baby," he said.
"I don't want a chance for that baby to catch microcephaly and I don't think I should have to take that chance."
Miss Santiago said: "I'm feeling a lot of stress. I'm depressed, I can't eat.
"If it wasn't about this virus Zika and advice of doctors and my mum telling me that I shouldn't go home, I would be home."
Earlier, supporting an application to extend her visa, her GP cited Public Health England advice over pregnant women travelling to Zika hotspots.
Miss Santiago, from São Paulo, met Mr Ellis online three and a half years ago.
She travelled to Kegworth to visit him in November and the couple got engaged about six weeks ago.
The couple changed her return flight to November - after the baby's due date - and applied to have her visa extended until then.

===Input Doc/Src: Most of the passengers are reported to be from Latin America.
The crash happened on Interstate 10 close to the resort town of Palm Springs in the early hours of Sunday morning.
Investigators are examining the cause of the crash, which happened as the bus was bound for Los Angeles.
Rescuers used ladders to climb into the bus windows to remove bodies. Five of the injured passengers are in critical condition.
The Los Angeles Times described the crash as the deadliest in California for several decades. It said that the bus careered into the rear of the truck at high speed, mangling the front third of the bus.
Most of those who died were apparently at the front of the bus, the newspaper reported. The driver was among the fatalities.
Officials quoted by the paper said that identifying the victims could take days, because some were not carrying identity cards or had lost their belongings when they were taken to hospital.
They have warned that it may not be possible to determine exactly why the accident happened because of the driver's death.
Investigators will assess whether he might have fallen asleep or had a heart attack, in addition to determining if there was a mechanical failure or some other kind of emergency.
The westbound lanes of the interstate were closed near the crash site but are now reported to have been reopened.
According to the Desert Sun newspaper, the tour bus, run by US Holiday, was coming from Red Earth Casino, near Salton City in California.
The small Los Angeles-based company, runs trips to casinos in California and Las Vegas. The driver of the bus was one of the owners of the tour company.

===Input Doc/Src: Tree surgeon Jon Sterkel told the BBC he used an explosive rifle target which sent blue smoke billowing into the air.
The blast was reportedly so loud that it was heard nearly 5km (3 miles) away.
Mr Sterkel has apologised after causing a police alert. He said that he was not aware his actions were illegal.
"The explosives I bought are readily available in most department stores, and even most law enforcers I have spoken to are not aware that they are illegal," he told the BBC.
He said that he had detonated exploding targets before on his remote farmland west of Scottsbluff, Nebraska, without upsetting anyone.
How are new babies celebrated around the world?
He said that Saturday's explosion contained blue smoke - caused by chalk powder - to tell the outside world that his wife Ashley is expecting a baby boy.
Mr Sterkel, 26, can be heard proclaiming "it's a boy!" on the video of the explosion which has been widely featured on numerous US websites.
But the blast was so loud that police in nearby Scottsbluff were alerted, with some residents concerned that a major disaster had taken place.
Mr Sterkel said that he immediately called the local sheriff to explain what had happened in addition to  apologising for his actions.
"I would like to say sorry for all of the confusion," he said. "I am a man of character and will willingly go to court if the district attorney chooses to prosecute me.
"This was just our way of announcing what gender our baby was."
Mr Sterkel faces charges for detonating the explosive without a valid permit. There was no damage or injury but he could be punished with a prison sentence and a fine of $1,000 (Â£800).
Police told the Omaha World Herald that although exploding targets, which are detonated when shot with a high powered rifle, have recently become popular, people who use them need to follow the correct procedures.
Mr Sterkel told the BBC that he does not plan any more spectacular blasts once the baby, his first child, is born around 16 June.

===Input Doc/Src: These are some of the scenarios being mooted by an increasingly excited blockchain community.
The technology that underpins the cryptocurrency Bitcoin is nothing new - it's been around for decades. It's just an encrypted database that's distributed across a computer network.
But what makes it different is it can only be updated when everyone on that network agrees, and once entered the information can't be overwritten, making it extremely secure and reliable.
And trust, as we know, underpins most business transactions.
"Blockchain, for perhaps the first time, presents a legitimate threat to the status quo," says Terry Roche, head of financial technology research at financial advisory firm, Tabb Group.
The tech has spawned a new generation of start-ups looking to find new, related applications, from peer-to-peer lending to smart contracts.
For example, OpenBazaar is a way people can sell anything to anyone, anywhere in the world using bitcoins.
Unlike with eBay or Amazon, users don't visit a website but download a programme that directly connects them with other potential buyers and sellers.
"Our goal is to unbundle the incumbent marketplaces around the world by offering a more private, secure and flexible option that isn't controlled by any one corporate interest, but rather, by the users themselves," developer Brian Hoffman tells the BBC.
According to OpenBazaar, cutting out the middleman means there are no fees, no restrictions, no accounts to create, and you only reveal the personal information you feel comfortable sharing.
The software is now in its testing phase and has been downloaded nearly 20,000 times in the last three weeks. Other decentralised marketplace concepts include Syscoin, which is also a digital currency.
Another major development exciting the industry are smart contracts, programmes that can automatically verify that contract terms have been met, and, once that has been done, authorise payment - all in real time without any need for middlemen.

But Kyrgyz authorities said they had questioned the man and that he had played no part in the attack.
Turkish media have run images of a suspect, saying they were given out by the police.
But the police have given no official details of the search for the suspect.
The passport image circulated on social media shows a similar-looking man to the suspect, but the head of the Kyrgyz security services told the BBC that the passport holder was not involved.
Rakhat Sulaimanov said the man had been questioned by both their agents and Turkish security and that he had nothing to do with the attack.
The Kyrgyz authorities say they were not contacted by their Turkish counterparts about the possible connection. Tairbek Sarpashev from the Kyrgyz state registration service, said they only started to investigate the man in question after seeing the media reports.
Turkish media have said the man police are investigating is from Central Asia and had rented a flat in the central city of Konya with a woman believed to be his wife and two children, who have been detained.

Reports from the scene say he fired more than 100 rounds, shooting at the wounded and setting off explosive devices as a distraction as he reloaded.

===Input Doc/Src: The Ministry of Justice announced a new formula for calculating compensation payments for those who suffer long-term injuries, which means insurers will have to increase payouts.
As a result, Direct Line said profits for 2016 had fallen 30% to £353m.
However, it said it had seen strong growth in home and car insurance.
While the changes to compensation calculations affected Direct Line's results for 2016, the company added that it did "not expect any material residual impact on 2017 profit" as a result of the reform.
When the change to the payout formula was announced, a number of insurance companies said their profits would be hit.
The Ministry of Justice said it was reducing what is known as the discount rate from 2.5% to minus 0.75%.
The move will result in more money for the victims of accidents, and so increase costs for insurance companies.

===Input Doc/Src: It is estimated the new law could raise up to Â£1m a year for the Welsh NHS.
The bill's sponsor, Labour AM Mick Antoniw, said it would help people whose lives had been blighted by "this terrible disease".
The insurance industry has raised concerns, questioning whether the move is within the assembly's powers.
Before becoming an assembly member, Mr Antoniw was a solicitor at the legal firm which has acted for many asbestos victims and their families.
Speaking before the bill was passed, he said: "It is only right that medical costs incurred by the NHS should be recovered from those who caused the disease and used to give more support to asbestos victims and their families - for example, a cancer nurse costs Â£50,000 per annum.
"We could employ an additional 20 cancer nurses or a mixture of cancer nurses and counsellors or additional research into the cause and treatment of asbestos disease.
"It is my belief this new Welsh law can make a significant improvement to the quality of life of those whose life is blighted by this terrible disease."
Last December assembly Presiding Officer Rosemary Butler certified that the bill was within the institution's powers, but admitted it was a "finely balanced" decision on some aspects of the legislation.
The Association of British Insurers (ABI) wrote to her and the secretary of state for Wales with a number of what it called "serious concerns" about the bill's lawfulness.
---Sum/Tgt: A bill to recover the costs of treating Welsh asbestos patients from businesses or insurers has been passed by assembly members.

===Input Doc/Src: Express Wi-fi allows users to purchase data from local providers in order to access the web.
A pilot version with a state-run telecoms company has already been offered at 125 rural wi-fi hotspots.
In a statement, Facebook said the tests were being carried out with "multiple local ISP partners".
Facebook is probably hoping that users who first encounter the web via a Facebook initiative will be more likely to become users of the social network - rather than a competitor - according to Ian Fogg, an analyst at IHS Technology.
"In emerging economies, Facebook is pursuing an intervention strategy to increase the pace of internet and online usage because this will also raise the addressable market for Facebook," he told the BBC.
Earlier this year, Facebook's Free Basics internet service app was blocked by India's telecoms regulator.
A ruling in favour of net neutrality put a stop to the plans, which would have offered free access to a select number of websites only.

===Input Doc/Src: Mason has joined Championship rivals Wolves on a three-and-a-half-year deal for an undisclosed fee.
Hudson played alongside Mason, who scored 22 goals in 60 league starts since joining Cardiff from Plymouth in 2011
"I wouldn't want to see him leave my squad," Huddersfield's Hudson said.
Former Republic of Ireland Under-21 forward Mason had been a target for Wolves in the summer.
"For me it's a strange one why they would need to sell to a rival club, especially another team looking to push into the play-offs," Hudson added.
"I think he's a great player, his movement and the way he ghosts in and out of games. He always hits the target when he gets a chance.
"If he's playing week in, week out I think he's probably going to be one of the top-scorers in the league."
Wolves' Wales midfielder Dave Edwards, who will be out for 12 weeks after having surgery on a foot injury, says Mason would be a "much needed addition" to the squad.
"We're a bit low on numbers at the moment, especially in the forward areas," Edwards told BBC Wales Sport.
"I've always been impressed every time I've seen him.
"I thought he played very well at Molineux a few weeks ago when we were beaten 3-1 [by Cardiff].
"He works hard for the team and hasn't got a bad goalscoring record either. He'll be great for us."

He added: "We are not worried about Crusaders, our focus is only on what we do.
"We have brought in quality players and we have quality players coming back from injury so the squad if getting a bit bigger now.
"Our aim on Saturday is simple - three points and a clean sheet."

===Input Doc/Src: The news comes on the day that the ASA upheld a complaint by Morrisons that three Aldi adverts were misleading.
But Morrisons said that despite Wednesday's ruling, Aldi had launched another similar price comparison advert which was just as unfair.
Aldi said in response to the new complaint that it believes its new advert fully complies with ASA rules.
Morrisons latest complaint is about a price comparison TV advert tied to the Euro 2016 football competition. "It's clear they haven't changed their ways," a Morrisons spokesman said.
On Wednesday, the ASA ruled that two Aldi TV adverts and one press ad that claimed consumers could make significant savings were misleading.
One TV ad claimed a Â£70 Aldi shop would cost Â£98 at the "big four" supermarkets.
Morrisons and two members of the public complained the adverts did not make it clear Aldi's own-brand products were being compared with branded products.
However Aldi, said comparative advertising was a "well-established principle".
The German discount supermarket chain said consumers were likely to interpret the comparison as intended - the branded and fresh products from Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons shown versus the Aldi products shown.
The ASA said: "We acknowledged that Aldi stated they had not intended the comparisons to represent a 'typical' weekly shop, but to be a comparison between the pictured products only.
"Nonetheless, we considered that was how consumers would interpret the adverts rather than as a representation of the savings which could be made by switching from a largely branded shop to shopping in Aldi, and therefore assessed them on that basis."
Aldi's UK and Ireland chief executive Matthew Barnes said it was "extremely disappointed" with the "ambiguous and inconsistent" decision.
"The use of comparative advertising is a well-established principle and is firmly in the interests of consumers and encourages competition between retailers," he said.
---Sum/Tgt: Supermarket Morrisons is to make a new complaint to the Advertising Standards Authority about discount chain Aldi.

===Input Doc/Src: And now he has become Scotland's only Labour MP by retaining his Edinburgh South seat in the face of an SNP landslide in the Westminster election.
As the chairman of the Foundation of Hearts, a supporters group which helps to fund the club via monthly donations, Mr Murray had a central role in getting the club out of administration.
He was first elected for the seat in 2010 after serving as an Edinburgh councillor between 2003 and 2010 for the capital's Liberton and Gilmerton ward.
Mr Murray has served in parliament as a Parliamentary Private Secretary and Shadow Business Minister. Up until the election in May he was the Shadow Minister for Trade and Investment.
Murray was born to a cooper father and shop worker mother in August 1976.
Brought up in the Wester Hailes area of Edinburgh, he went to Dumbryden primary school, then Wester Hailes Education Centre.
Mr Murray studied social policy and Law at Edinburgh University and graduated with an Honours degree at the age of 20.
He worked to fund his studies with a part-time job in a local fish and chip shop, where he then set up and ran a pizza delivery service.
After graduating in 1997, Mr Murray worked in financial services before setting up an internet television station.
He then started his own event management business running large festival events.  He has also owned a small bar and hotel business, running several premises.
In 2004, Mr Murray organised a charity concert for a Landmine Free World with artists Billy Bragg, Chrissie Hynde, Steve Earle, Joan Baez and Emmylou Harris, which raised more than Â£100,000.
Mr Murray, who lives with his partner Hannah, also organised a student exchange programme in Nepal to fund school buildings and staff.

===Input Doc/Src: The year, of course, was 1996. With England's European Championship campaign ending in penalty defeat, it was tournament debutants the Czech Republic who claimed a place in the hearts of a nation.
From 66-1 outsiders at the start to almost upsetting Germany in the final, the Czechs had come so close to completing the perfect underdog story.
And it all began at Bamber Bridge.
"I was mowing the pitch when I was called in to take a call from a nearby hotel," remembers Russ Rigby, former groundsman, secretary and kitman at the non-league side, who are in FA Cup action this weekend against Kettering Town.
"It was the hotel's manager and he just asked if we would be interested in playing the Czech Republic in a warm-up game for the European Championship."
Rigby recalled he almost dropped the phone in surprise. After all, it is not every day that a team that has never played higher than the sixth tier of English football gets presented with the opportunity to play an international side.
Needless to say the offer was quickly accepted, but why exactly did a team containing emerging talents like Pavel Nedved, Karel Poborsky and Patrik Berger sound out a non-league side from the north west of England for a friendly?
"They were playing Germany in their opening game of Euro '96 at Old Trafford a few days later, so they were based close by," adds Rigby.
"Preston North End had been approached initially but didn't want the game for some reason or another, so they passed on my number."
Dusan Uhrin, the Czech Republic manager, travelled to the Lancashire village to check out the facilities and complete the formalities of arranging the friendly.
"We'd had the pitch relaid. It wasn't perfect but it was all right," says Rigby.
"The Czech manager didn't speak any English so we had to go through an interpreter, but he was happy with the surface.
"He warned us, though, that he didn't want a physical game, otherwise he'd take his players off if it got out of hand."

===Input Doc/Src: The authorities moved in early on Tuesday to break up a makeshift protest camp in the city centre. Several others were injured.
Protests began almost three weeks ago, after a massive vehicle bomb in the city centre left more than 150 dead.
Demonstrators accuse the government of failing to provide security.
Pledging an investigation into the overnight violence, Afghan Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah said one person been killed and six wounded.
"These kinds of incidents damage the trust between the government and the people," he said.
Demonstrators put the number of dead at two. Street clashes broke out after the authorities demolished the camp. Police responded with live rounds, AFP news agency reports.
Afghan intelligence officials have blamed the 31 May bomb attack on the Haqqani network, a Taliban affiliate with alleged support from Pakistan.
The Taliban and the Haqqani group denied any involvement. Islamabad strongly rejected the claim.
The bombing sparked anti-government protests just days later in which four people were killed, as police used tear gas and fired bullets into the air to keep crowds at bay.
Three suicide bombers then attacked the funeral at the weekend of one of those killed in the protests, killing at least seven people.
The Kabul protest began peacefully the day after the bombing three weeks ago. Demonstrators demanded the execution of Taliban detainees and the sacking of senior security officials.
Soon however fierce critics of President Ashraf Ghani, many of them members of Jamiat Islami which has a 50% stake in the government, took over the protest and violence ensued. They wanted the government dismantled altogether. Police called them rioters who wanted to storm the presidential palace.
Some members of Jamiat accuse President Ghani of bigotry and favouritism, and of micromanaging the entire government. They want his right hand man, security adviser Hanif Atmar, removed.

===Input Doc/Src: The management gender pay gap stands at an average of £3,188 - or 13%.
Although this is less than the UK average of 22%, the Chartered Management Institute (CMI) said it was still "unacceptable".
The findings are in its annual salary survey of more than 72,000 professionals across the UK.
How big is the gap?
The findings are reflected in the most recent Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures. These show women in professional occupations in Wales received an average of £678 gross pay a week in 2014  - compared to men on £794 a week.
That 15% gap also exists between women and men's pay across all sectors in Wales - and has remained largely unchanged for a decade.
It is slightly better than the UK average - 20% and 19% if you exclude London and the south east.
The ONS said it was a complex issue and prefers we look at median hourly earnings for those in full-time work, which suggests the pay gap is now the lowest on record.
It is now 9.4% between all working men and women - around £100 a week - compared to 17.4% in 1997.
Why does the pay gap exist?
Cardiff University researchers last year found the working patterns of men and women are very different.
"Feminised" jobs attract lower hourly pay rates and have high concentrations of part-time hours, it suggested.
In summary:
The university research team claimed, with little training or career progression opportunities, women can get "stuck" in these working patterns for life.
ANALYSIS by Sarah Dickins, BBC Wales economics correspondent
Forty five years after the UK Government passed the Equal Pay Act, working women in Wales are still earning on average more than £3,000 less than men.  In effect they are working for 34 days each year for free.
In Wales the gap between what men and women earn is less - at 13% - than for the UK as a whole, which is 22%. On the face of it, that may seem to be good news and could be used to suggest that Wales is a more equal society. But it could also be seen as a reflection of the fact

House of Fraser, which has 59 shops across the UK and Ireland, said like-for-like sales jumped 8% for the six weeks to 3 January, versus last year.
Sales in the week before Christmas were the 165-year old firm's best ever.
Both retailers' saw a sharp increase in online sales compared to last year, with Waitrose reporting a 26.3% rise in online grocery sales, and House of Fraser seeing a 31.2% jump.
Waitrose, which has 334 shops, is owned by John Lewis, which reported strong festive trading figures on Monday.

===Input Doc/Src: Gerald Sunnie received cheques worth tens of thousands of pounds from three pensioners.
He then forwarded the money to "individuals across Europe" while keeping a share of the cash.
He was convicted of a £33,000 money laundering charge under the Proceeds of Crime Act.
Dundee Sheriff Court heard that Sunnie initially became involved after being "deluded" into thinking that he had won a £200,000 American lottery prize that had not turned up.
Sunnie started taking in cheques that he was told were to cover "European tax liabilities" on his winnings, passing the money on after taking his portion of it.
The 58-year-old's bank accounts were closed down due to "fraudulent activity" and he was twice told by Trading Standards officers that he was helping to facilitate an international fraud.
But he started up his activity again in August 2013, taking in dozens of cheques from three elderly victims over the course of the next year.
He told his trial that a man from the fraudsters he was passing the money to had called him two weeks earlier saying his £200,000 winnings were still on the way, and that he still expected a cheque to come through his door.
Sunnie's lawyer Gary McIlravey admitted that his client was "deluded".
Depute fiscal Muhammad Sadiq, prosecuting, said: "It's clear he may have been a victim at first, but he did then benefit by processing payments on numerous occasions after being told it was a scam."
Sheriff Simon Collins QC convicted Sunnie of money laundering, saying a large number of vulnerable people had been defrauded out of a large sum of money.
The sheriff added: "By any standard the arrangement he entered, even from the outset, was obviously a scam.
"He was told it was a scam and that he was taking part in a fraud and his bank accounts were closed.
"He processed nearly £52,000 but claimed not to have made even inquiries of those involved in these arrangements. This stretches credulity."

"We are a proud Singaporean company and do not condone such language or behaviour, hence we have since terminated his engagement once the incident came to light."
Responding to the online anger at Mr Truyen, Mr Cheng also asked readers not to spread "messages of hate and division, but instead embrace our diversity".

===Input Doc/Src: Unite was responding to Plaid Cymru's economy spokesman Adam Price, who urged steel workers to reject a move from final salary pensions.
Balloting is expected to begin at the end of January.
Tata said pension reform is essential to a deal that would see Â£1bn invested at Port Talbot over 10 years.
The company made a commitment to secure jobs and production at Port Talbot and its other steelworks in December.
But Plaid AM Mr Price said Tata was being "opportunistic", adding workers should ask it to rethink the offer.
The financial climate around the steel industry has changed over the last 12 months.
World steel prices have risen from $385 per tonne of hot rolled coil a year ago, when Tata announced more than 1,000 UK job losses, to $536 per tonne by August just after the company put the sale of its Welsh operations on hold.
China had been accused of selling surplus steel to Europe at below cost price, driving down its market value.
But last summer, the European Union continued imposing tariffs on foreign imports - with up to 22% levied on cold rolled steel, which is used in cars and washing machines.
And the turnaround plan put in place at the biggest plant, Port Talbot, saw the reported losses of Â£1m a day at the site reduced.
Mark Turner, a Unite union official at Port Talbot, said: "When politicians start making comments on either side, they need to understand what they're doing and the influence they have on people.
"There are personal decisions to make but also the future of the steel industry, there are a lot of things people have to take into consideration.
"We'd like politicians to keep their opinions to themselves for the time being."
Meanwhile, Aberavon MP Stephen Kinnock criticised Mr Price, saying he was "astonished" at his intervention, given the delicacy of the situation.
"This is a very personal decision that the steelworkers have to make, based on a range of factors," said the Labour MP.
"There have been some very impressive proposals from Tata Stee

The 1920s landmark was badly damaged and is being dismantled for repair.
Ceredigion council aims to completely re-open the promenade to the public by Easter after it was battered by high tides and storms.
Volunteers had been asked to join the promenade clean-up at 10:00 GMT and more than 200 turned out, with buckets and shovels.
As well as students, one man had travelled from Gloucestershire to help clear shingle from the walkway.
Charlotte Dubenskij reports from Aberystwyth
Children filled their buckets up with scoops of the pebbles brought over onto the promenade by high waves over the last week.
Parents and grandparents monitored their progress as they worked side with shovels and sweeping brushes.
Others looked after those who toiled, offering snacks and drinks for the weary workers.
One woman told me she came to do her bit as her husband found the prom therapeutic.
"He has ill health and the one thing that keeps him going is a walk along here everyday," she said.
There is a real sense of community here as the clean up comes into its final phase.
Elsewhere, the A487 in Newgale, Pembrokeshire, has been reopened after tonnes of shingle washed onto it during the storm.

Pre-tax profits also fell substantially, from £21.3m to £6.6m.
Celtic were knocked out of the Champions League in August after losing to Slovenian side Maribor. They are currently playing in the UEFA Europa League.
The club also cited lower gains from the sale of players as a reason for the poorer trading performance.
Revenues from multimedia and other commercial activities fell from £19.5m to less than £8m, while merchandising revenues also dropped.
In a statement, chairman Ian Bankier said: "As in previous years, the second half is expected to be more challenging in terms of financial performance with fewer home matches scheduled and no certainty on any further gains on the disposal of player registrations.
"Our strategy remains to live within our means.
"The football environment in Scotland continues to be challenging and we must operate within it in a fashion that does not unduly risk the long term future of this great club.
"Our key focus for the remainder of the year will be to build on the progress we have made in the first half of the season and to deliver silverware from competing in the three domestic competitions and remain competitive in the UEFA Europa League."

===Input Doc/Src: Last month Oldham denied reports they were set to offer the 26-year-old a contract, or let him train with them, but it is believed they have now had a change of heart.
Striker Evans has been without a club since he left prison in October.
The Wales international served half of a five-year term for raping a woman in a hotel in May 2011.
An online petition against Oldham signing Evans was set up on Sunday and had been signed by almost 19,000 people by 23:30 GMT.
Former Oldham player Rick Holden told BBC Radio 5 live he was "not comfortable at all" with the possibility of Evans joining the Latics.
"It's one of those crimes that will never go away," said Holden, who played 189 games for Oldham between 1989 and 1993.
"I don't see how the chap can survive given the ferocity of football up and down the land."
Holden, who played 189 games for Oldham between 1989 and 1993, said the club were "courting controversy", but added that they had "a history of taking on these difficult challenges".
Earlier on Sunday, Professional Footballers' Association chief executive Gordon Taylor had revealed that an unnamed club would hold a news conference regarding Evans on Monday, although he added that the player has yet to be signed.
"We've had a number of steps forward and a number of steps back. I'm not going to count my chickens," Taylor told BBC Radio 5 live's Sportsweek programme.
"If a club are looking to sign him they need to be 100% committed."
If Oldham were to sign Evans it would not be the first time they have signed a striker who had served a prison sentence. In 2007 they signed Lee Hughes after he had served half of a six-year prison term for causing death by dangerous driving.
In November, Oldham chairman Simon Corney told BBC Radio Manchester that he felt people should be given a "second chance".
"I believe in the law of the land and my understanding is Ched went away and did his time in prison," he said.

===Input Doc/Src: Cherryl Henry-Leach from Doncaster Children's Services Trust, which runs Getting On, said it was one of the only programmes of its kind in the UK.
Families work with police, the health service, voluntary sector and council to avoid violence at home.
Ms Henry-Leach said parents were often reluctant to get help.
"They feel shame and stigma attached to being a victim of domestic abuse, while also fearing the consequences for their child if reported," she said.
The programme seeks to stop children moving from one abusive relationship to another, using a "whole-family approach" unique to Doncaster to build families' self-esteem and resilience, Ms Henry-Leach said.
Many teenagers on the programme have lived with domestic violence between parents so the project attempts to "de-normalise" abuse and help them move on to healthier relationships.
Mother and son, Anne and Luke (not their real names) from Doncaster, said the techniques derived from University of Oxford research taught them how to listen.
"There was a lot of swearing and abusive behaviour before," Anne said.  "Luke never actually hit me, but he'd go to hit me, or push me which could be frightening.
"I can now sit down and talk to my son without us shouting at each other. We can actually have a conversation without being abusive.
Luke agreed that they have a "healthier relationship."
Five Doncaster families have now completed the nine week programme, which is funded by Â£3.1m from the Department for Education's Innovation Fund.
A further six families are still on the programme.
---Sum/Tgt: A project aiming to tackle violence suffered by parents at the hands of their children has been hailed a success in Doncaster.

===Input Doc/Src: However, Health Minister Michelle O'Neill said no such plan was being considered.
Charles and Elma Hamilton's son, Ian, took his own life in 2013.  He was 38 and a father of two children.
He had suffered from mental health problems for many years.
An inquest heard that 24 hours before his death, Ian had been to three hospitals in two different health trusts.
Ian was first diagnosed with depression in 1998. He was deeply troubled and had problems with alcohol and drug addiction.
However, his post-mortem showed no sign of substance abuse.
His parents said the establishment of a single trust to deal with people with psychiatric conditions could help other people in the future.
The couple believe a single system would help ensure that a patient's notes, capturing their full history, would be accessible to all medics, no matter where they showed up for help.
Charles Hamilton said part of the problem for Ian was that he moved between health trusts.
"I think if they had a single mental health trust, where everything was collated together, all the information concerning the people presenting with mental health problems would be there there at the push of a button," he said.
"That way, professionals can access the patient's history and there are no delays in getting that patient treatment."
Elma Hamilton said Ian's final hours were very distressing.
"He went to three hospitals in two trusts inside 24 hours, trying to get help, pleading with people trying to get his point across," she said.
"He was frustrated and hopeless - he just couldn't get the answers he needed. In one hospital, he was waiting 10 hours to see someone from a mental health team.
"In a different hospital, he self-harmed. He was tired having to go through the same story so many times to different people."
His story highlights how, too often, there is a lack of joined up thinking between mental health services and how sometimes an emergency department is not the best place to treat those with a serious psycho

More specialist contractors were brought in as the work progressed and the budget began to rise.
A council spokeswoman told BBC Scotland the last agreed budget was just under £4.3m but that the final bill for the project was still being calculated.
She said: "We can confirm that the restoration of the roof of the Town House, one of Aberdeen's historic civic buildings, is now complete.
"The scaffolding erected on Union Street came down over the weekend as the repairs came to a close.
"In the past two years the project has revealed many ornate and historic features which are unique to the UK.
"As the work progressed the scope was widened to account for additional structural issues which were previously not evident in initial assessments and which led to the schedule and budget being extended.
"This included the exposure of rotten wood in the building's four towers which were found underneath the slates and lead last summer that had to be replaced."
The spokeswoman added: "We made a commitment to bring this important civic building back to life and are delighted the project has now come to a close.
"The final cost of the project is still to be confirmed."

Cousins Resham Khan and Jameel Muhktar had been celebrating Ms Khan's 21st birthday before the attack.
John Tomlin, 24, is described as white, 6ft tall, of stocky build and with short fair hair.
The new images show Mr Tomlin, who has distinctive hand and face tattoos, entering a shop in Romford on 3 July.
Mr Tomlin is also known to frequent the Canning Town area.
Ms Khan, a student at Manchester Metropolitan University, and Mr Muhktar suffered severe burns to the face and body in the attack on 21 June.
"Within seconds, my cousin started screaming. Her eyes were blistered, her face started melting. My face started melting", Mr Muhktar said.
According to police, they had stopped at traffic lights when the man approached them and threw the toxic substance at Ms Khan through the window.
The attacker then circled around the car and threw more of the acid at Mr Muhktar, before eventually fleeing the scene.
Mr Muhktar, 37, had to be temporarily placed in an induced coma to treat his injuries.
"I'm in a really bad way. I'm going to be scarred for life. I can't walk properly, I can't hear properly, I can't sleep", he said.

===Input Doc/Src: More than 6,800 people have been killed and 35,000 injured since March 2015, the majority in air strikes by a Saudi-led multinational coalition that backs the president.
The conflict and a blockade imposed by the coalition have also triggered a humanitarian disaster, leaving 80% of the population in need of aid.
The conflict has its roots in the failure of the political transition that was supposed to bring stability to Yemen following an uprising that forced its longtime authoritarian president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, to hand over power to Mr Hadi, his deputy, in November 2011.
Mr Hadi struggled to deal with a variety of problems, including attacks by al-Qaeda, a separatist movement in the south, the continuing loyalty of many military officers to Mr Saleh, as well as corruption, unemployment and food insecurity.
The Houthi movement, which champions Yemen's Zaidi Shia Muslim minority and fought a series of rebellions against Mr Saleh during the previous decade, took advantage of the new president's weakness by taking control of their northern heartland of Saada province and neighbouring areas.
Disillusioned with the transition, many ordinary Yemenis - including Sunnis - supported the Houthis and in September 2014 they entered the capital, Sanaa, setting up street camps and roadblocks.
In January 2015, the Houthis reinforced their takeover of Sanaa, surrounding the presidential palace and other key points and effectively placing Mr Hadi and his cabinet ministers under house arrest.
The president escaped to the southern port city of Aden the following month.
The Houthis and security forces loyal to Mr Saleh then attempted to take control of the entire country, forcing Mr Hadi to flee abroad in March 2015.
Alarmed by the rise of a group they believed to be backed militarily by regional Shia power Iran, Saudi Arabia and eight other mostly Sunni Arab states began an air campaign aimed at restoring Mr Hadi's government.

===Input Doc/Src: In a letter to the Daily Telegraph, they said early schooling was causing "profound damage" to children.
They are calling for more emphasis in the curriculum on learning through play.
England's Education Minister Elizabeth Truss said starting school later would damage attempts to close the achievement gap between rich and poor.
The signatories to the letter, including academics, teachers and some writers and charities, said the current system focused too much on formal education, such as the "three Rs", at too early an age.
They said national policies should be reassessed to make them more similar to education systems in Scandinavia.

In England, Scotland, Wales, Cyprus and Malta, the age is five.
The statutory age is six in Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Republic of Ireland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Romania,  Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland and Turkey.

Mr Osborne questioned the wisdom of quoting backbenchers in a dig at the unrest in Labour ranks.
He also pledged £50m in flood relief.
Mr Cameron is attempting to secure reforms to the UK's relationship with the EU before holding an in-out referendum by the end of 2017.
Ms Eagle, who was greeted with loud cheers as she stood up at the despatch box, said Mr Cameron had been "jetting all over the place" on his "seemingly endless European tour", adding to laughter from Labour ranks: "Can I ask the chancellor: How's it all going?"
"The good news is we have a leader who is respected abroad," replied Mr Osborne, saying the PM was "fighting for a better deal for Britain, something that would never have happened had there been a Labour government".
George Osborne, the bookies' favourite to replace David Cameron as Conservative leader, was then asked whether he really aspired to be "the first post-EU prime minister" by Ms Eagle, who quoted some Eurosceptic Conservative MPs as being "pretty unimpressed by how it's going".
She then imitated Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's PMQs approach of reading out questions from emails he has received.
In this case it was "Donald from Brussels" - a reference to EU Council president Donald Tusk, who warned of the "destabilising" effect of uncertainty over the UK's future in Europe in a letter to fellow EU leaders this week.
Mr Osborne said the UK had received the "lion's share" of EU investment since announcing its EU referendum plans.
George Osborne went on to say "someone called Tony" has been writing today, referred her to comments from former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair, who said in an interview published today that the current state of the party was a complete "tragedy".

Rodney Brown nodded in from a Brad Lyons cross to put the Bannsiders ahead but the Blues hit back with Aaron Burns heading home the equaliser.
Matthew Clarke's side-foot finish moved Linfield in front before Coleraine defender David Ogilby was sent-off for two yellows on 67 minutes.
Jamie Mulgrew poked in Linfield's third as they maintained their 100% record.
Coleraine made the early running and were rewarded on 23 minutes when Brown scored against his former club with a downward header into the bottom corner.
Blues forward Guy Bates had almost sent a clearance into his own net and headed wide of the Coleraine goal before he set up Linfield's two first-half goals.
His dinked cross picked out the unmarked Burns as the midfielder netted his fifth goal of the campaign while Clarke rifled home from a tight angle at the back post.
Lyons saw his goalbound shot deflected over by Sean Ward before Clarke's goal while Brown went close twice before the break.
A dull second half came to life when Ogilby was controversially dismissed after the defender appeared to make minimal contact with Andrew Waterworth.
Linfield capitalised with the extra man two minutes later - substitute Mulgrew jinked into the box before prodding the ball beyond keeper Michael Doherty.
"We knew it was going to difficult and this was about the result, not the performance," said Linfield boss Warren Feeney.

Political leaders on Saturday paid their respects to the dead man.
His body was laid out at the headquarters of the opposition Liberal party in the capital, Asuncion.
They condemned the killing and called for an investigation into his death.
Around 200 protesters were detained but many have since been released.
The protesters had taken to the streets following a private meeting of 25 senators - a slight majority of the house - which approved a bill to amend the constitution.
Paraguay was controlled by military ruler General Alfredo Stroessner, who seized power in a coup, from 1954 until 1989.
The current constitution, created in 1992 after the dictatorship, limits the head of state to a single five-year term.
Protesters were angered by the bill which would have allowed President Cartes' to remove the restriction and run for re-election.
An opposition senator, Desiree Masi, called the move a coup and called on supporters to resist it.

It follows the crash of Malaysia airliner MH17 in Ukraine and growing tensions between Russia and the west.
Ms Moon, who sits on the Commons defence committee, called for a halt in a decline on defence spending.
A total of 298 people were on board MH17, when it was reportedly hit by a missile over a rebel-held area in Donetsk region on Thursday.
Ukraine and the pro-Russian rebels have accused each other of shooting down the Boeing 777, which was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur.
Western countries have criticised restrictions imposed by rebels at the crash site, and have asked Russia to pressurise them to allow more access.
Ms Moon said the "callous" behaviour of militia followed the annexation of Ukraine adding that Russian president Vladimir Putin had to realise that the "world is outraged".
She said: "I think we have to act as if we're entering a new Cold War.
"We've had Russian ships, we have had Russian submarines off our coast for the last few years.
"We've had Russian planes entering very close to our airspace for years, testing our defences.
"We've got no maritime patrol capability - that needs to be replaced."
Ms Moon, who is also part of the Nato Parliamentary Assembly, told BBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement Britain had ignored Russia's "flexing of its muscles".

I had hopes of number ones, but I never thought it would actually happen.
When you come from being a featured artist there's a sudden fear: "Oh God, was it me that people liked - or was it Disclosure and Naughty Boy?"
So when Money On My Mind came out, it was a reassurance - a boost of confidence for me. Just letting me know "things are good, people like your songwriting".

===Input Doc/Src: Seven protesters were arrested overnight outside the immigration office where she was being held.
Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos, 36, a mother of two US-born children, crossed the southern border from Nogales, Arizona at 10:00 local time.
Protesters had tried to block vehicles transporting her, but were unable.
On Wednesday night, protesters, who feared her deportation under President Donald Trump's clampdown on immigration, blocked a van believed to be carrying Ms de Rayos.
It was one of several vehicles stopped from leaving the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) centre on Wednesday evening.
"Seeing my mom in that van... it was unexplainable. It was really heart-dropping," her daughter Jaqueline said during a press conference after the deportation was announced.
"No one should ever go through the pain of having their mom taken away from them, or the pain of packing her suitcase," the 14-year-old said through tears.
According to US media Ms de Rayos was arrested in 2008 during a raid on her workplace and was convicted of identity theft for possessing false papers.
But she was allowed to continue living in Arizona as long as she checked in with her local ICE office in Phoenix every six months, the report adds.

===Input Doc/Src: Vehicle examiner Philip Balderstone said he could reach the brake with his foot - but only by hand when he was standing without a seatbelt on.
The fatal accident inquiry (FAI) has heard two crewmen on board during the crash were seated with their belts on.
The inquiry is examining the lorry, its route and driver Harry Clarke's health.
Mr Balderstone was giving evidence on the third day of the FAI, which is being overseen by Sheriff John Beckett QC at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
The vehicle examination consultant, who works for the Transport Research Laboratory, was asked to produce a report on the bin lorry following the crash on 22 December last year.
The court has already heard that the front driver section of the lorry cab and the rear crew section was separated by a metal bar.
Mr Balderstone's report noted that the vehicle had an emergency stop button for its rear machinery.
This, however, was not connected to the chassis or drive of the lorry, meaning it could not stop the vehicle.
The court was then shown a picture of Mr Balderstone in the vehicle cab, trying to reach the parking brake control from the rear crew section.
Mr Balderstone confirmed that he was able to reach the brake lever from the rear area and apply it "reasonably easily".
The court has previously heard that the two rear-seated crewmen on the day of the crash, Matthew Telford and Henry Toal, made no attempt to apply the brake and believed they could not reach it.
Mr Balderstone said he is 5ft 8in tall and could reach the parking brake "comfortably".
Solicitor General Lesley Thomson, Scotland's second most senior law officer, who is leading the FAI, then asked if someone who was 5ft 3in tall could reach the brake - this is the height that Mr Telford gave for himself during evidence on Wednesday.

"I believe passionately in the word of the Lord Jesus Christ and I am fighting for a principle."
In May 2014, the pastor delivered a sermon in which he described Islam as "heathen" and "satanic".
After the sermon was posted online, complaints led to a police investigation.
The evangelical preacher later issued a public apology for any offence caused.
The Public Prosecution Service says Pastor McConnell was offered an informed warning but he refused it.
While an informed warning is not a conviction, it is recorded on a person's criminal record for 12 months.
Anyone who refuses to accept it can be prosecuted.

===Input Doc/Src: The BHA aims to halt a decline in the number of horses taking part in races lower down the scale with an increase in prize money and appearance fees.
The scheme has the support of the Racecourse Association and Horsemen's Group.
The proposals come as the 2018 fixture list is released, with 1,508 meetings next year, 11 more than in 2017.
Richard Wayman, chief operating officer for the BHA, said: "Although there has been growth in total prize money in recent years, much of this has been at the top end. The returns to our sport's participants further down the scale are simply not sufficient at present to be sustainable.
"Targeting grassroots with extra funding will help racing's participants to maintain their involvement in the sport, keeping more horses in training, as well as helping with the recruitment and retention of staff to care for our horses."
The BHA proposes to invest additional levy income in racing from 2018, with the aim of delivering three key objectives for the sport - supporting ownership, delivering more competitive and compelling racing, and increasing customer engagement.
A statement by the BHA proposed that, in addition to the increased number on meetings next year, there will also be "customer-friendly slots on Friday evenings and Saturday afternoons throughout summer with the aim of increasing attendances".
"We need the fixture list and race programme to work in a manner that meets our customer's requirements. As customer and betting habits change it is essential that our sport evolves with them," Wayman added.
---Sum/Tgt: Grassroots racing will receive an extra £9.7m in 2018 under new proposals from the British Horseracing Authority.

===Input Doc/Src: The sleepy and nondescript town of 40,000 people ringed by farms sees activity only around its bus stand. Just a couple of trains arrive at its deserted railway station every day.
But this unremarkable place, 275km (170 miles) from the Indian capital, Delhi, is in news these days: it is the first town in India to offer full and cheap wi-fi coverage.
A few cities in India - Bangalore, Pune, Cochin, Delhi - have some public free wi-fi hotspots, but their impact is low.
From the bus stand and railway station to the streets and town market, the residents of Bhadra are now connected to the internet.  I tested it along the length of the town and experienced a seamless connection.
Local businessman Dalit Kumar Jain says he is pleased that he can now quickly download full-length movies on his phone and conduct business-related online money transfers.
The facility is a success among the students, who no longer have to rush to the main town of Hanumangarh, 160km (100 miles) away, for online lessons, job applications and alerts. The number of training centres for job tests has gone up in Bhadra after wi-fi arrived here in July.
Students of the local secondary school say they download exam test papers from the internet, and spend a lot of time on online games, and social media.
For a place which had just a few internet connections a few months ago, Bhadra is a good example of how cheap and speedy wi-fi can change people's lives - 1GB of data only costs 64 rupees (98 cents; 64p) every month.
Sandeep Yadav of MTS India, a Rajasthan-based company responsible for providing the facility, describes small, developing towns like Bhadra as the "nerve-centres of aspirational India".
"Even the residents of small towns are now learning to use data and smart phones. A place like Bhadra accounts for 160GB of data usage every day. This is why we think that a certain amount of free bandwidth would really benefit the inhabitants."
The company plans to roll out wi-fi services in 11 more small to

Currie's anticipated appointment was confirmed at Shamrock Park on Monday evening as his five-year stint as Ards manager came to an end.
The Portadown native, 44, emerged as the club's preferred candidate over the past week.
Currie, who has been handed an 18-month contract, takes over a side that are 13 points adrift at the bottom of the Premiership table.
Portadown started the season with a 12-point deduction for making irregular payments to players and were also handed a number of fines, in addition to being prevented from signing players on professional deals this season.
Despite the team's predicament, the new manager described his appointment as the "pinnacle for me".
"I was in a strong position and a secure job at Ards, but my heart led me here. The lure of coming home and managing my hometown club was too strong," said Currie at the news conference confirming his appointment.
"We're going through a tough time at the moment but I want to bring a smile back to this club.
"Our first priority is doing our utmost to stay in the league and we want to give it a real rattle."
Currie has arrived from Ards with long-term assistant Jay Willis while Trevor Williamson will remain part of the backroom team.
One of the new manager's first acts has been to recall former Linfield striker Mark McAllister to the first-team squad.
Back in September, then manager Pat McGibbon told McAllister that he was no longer part of the club's plans.
However, Currie believes the striker can be an asset to the squad.
"He's looking forward to playing and getting himself fit," said the new manager.
"We've got some good defenders and some good midfielders but I think we need to inject a bit of pace into the last third of the pitch."
A statement from Ards on Monday night said that the North Down club had received "an amount of compensation from Portadown for Currie's services" but that there would be "further discussions between the two clubs".

===Input Doc/Src: In the letter, the hugely popular chief minister of Tamil Nadu state says that she has "been reborn" thanks to the prayers of her supporters.
The letter also urged people to vote for her party in upcoming by-elections.
Critics say this could be an attempt to quell fears about the extent of her illness and mobilise her supporters.
The chief minister was last seen in public on 21 September and admitted to hospital a day later.

Ailing Tamil Nadu chief gives up powers
Initially, doctors said the 68-year-old was receiving treatment for "fever and dehydration". She was placed under observation and her diet was monitored. But since then there has been a fierce veil of secrecy around her health.
Last Saturday her doctors reportedly said she had "completely recovered" and would go home "whenever she feels fit".
"Due to the continuous prayers by people in Tamil Nadu, in other states and across the world, I have been reborn and I am happy to share this information with you," Ms Jayalalitha said in the letter released late Sunday.
But all her political responsibilities remain with her deputy O Panneerselvam.

===Input Doc/Src: Contact with flight MH370, carrying 239 people, was lost en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Despite an extensive search no trace has ever been found.
The trial system enables planes to be tracked every 15 minutes, an increase on the current 30 to 40 minutes.
It uses technology already installed on most long-haul jets.
The system is expected to increase the tracking rate to five minutes or less if there is any deviation from a plane's expected route.
Australian Transport Minister Warren Truss said the new system was a "world first". But he stressed the new technology would not necessarily have solved the mystery of MH370.
"It would have been very difficult, one would imagine, without knowing what precisely occurred in the case of MH370, to have intervened from outside," he said.
"But at least it would have tracked the aircraft to within 15 minutes."
Airservices Australia Chairman Angus Houston, who helped lead the search for MH370, agreed it was "no silver bullet".
"But it is an important step in delivering immediate improvements to the way we currently track aircraft while more comprehensive solutions are developed," he added.
The trial will begin in the Australian city of Brisbane, before being extended to Indonesia and Malaysia.
Investigators searching for MH370 are focusing on an area of the Indian Ocean off the coast of western Australia.

===Input Doc/Src: Mr Kejriwal spent Monday night in the open and conducted business with cabinet members from the street.
His administration had accused the police of failing to deal with an alleged drugs and prostitution ring - something they denied.
The chief minister says he has won concessions from central government.
By Soutik BiswasIndia correspondent
India's Arvind Kejriwal's 'anarchic' politics
The government, which commands Delhi's police force, has agreed to send on leave two police officers Mr Kejriwal wants suspended on allegations of misconduct.
"I'm very happy today. Today the people of Delhi have won. I want to congratulate the people of Delhi," AFP news agency quotes Mr Kejriwal as telling supporters.
The protest began on Monday when Mr Kejriwal was prevented from going to the home minister's office to demand the officers' suspension.
He was acting in response to an incident which threatened to become a diplomatic issue, putting his Aam Aadmi Party, the police and members of Delhi's African community at loggerheads.
Last Wednesday Mr Kejriwal's Law Minister, Somnath Bharti, and various party supporters allegedly confronted four Ugandan women in a Delhi neighbourhood, accusing them of prostitution.
Police refused to search a nearby house for evidence of the suspected drugs and prostitution ring because they did not have a warrant.
Mr Bharti and supporters of the Aam Aadmi Party were accused of threatening and intimidating the women, forcing their way into homes and making racist remarks - allegations they deny.
Mr Kejriwal's wider demands include police reform and transferring control of Delhi's police force from the federal authorities.
The chief minister also accuses the police of failing to protect women, following the fatal gang-rape of a student in December 2012.
The Aam Aadmi Party, or Common Man's Party, performed unexpectedly well in state elections on an anti-corruption platform, propelling Mr Kejriwal to the post of chief minister last month.

===Input Doc/Src: Inspectors said the "innovative and radical" work with prisoners' children at HMP Parc, Bridgend, was "probably the best we have seen".
It opened a 60-bed family interventions unit in 2010.
The Prison Officers Association (POA) said more staff and resources would help continue the work.
Prison inspectors reported on two unannounced visits they made at G4S-run Parc prison late in 2015 and early this year.
They found its work with families encouraged prisoner involvement with the lives of their child.
The family interventions unit at the privately-run prison, one of the largest in Wales and England, provides a range of programmes and activities for inmates aimed at helping them to maintain and improve their family relationships.
The prison has also worked with Barnardo's Cymru for about 10 years with the aim of making a visit to the jail less challenging for the children of fathers inside.
Inspectors said: "A prison analysis suggested that 69% of prisoners at Parc received regular visits compared with an average of 48% across the rest of England and Wales."
HMP Parc, which is also a young offenders' institution, houses more than 1,600 prisoners.
BBC Radio Wales current affairs programme Eye on Wales was given access to one intervention - a nursery rhyme session for fathers with young children hosted by the prison's charity-sector partner.
The men on the Rhyme Time session are inside for a range of offences including violence and drugs.
One of them told the programme: "My daughter was born while I was here, so I haven't had the chance to get a bond with her apart from being on groups like this.
"Through all these visits, the bond has come. Looking to when you actually get out the gates, from me never seeing my daughter on the outside, ever, I know she already knows that I'm her father and someone special in her life."
The head of the prison's family interventions programme, Corin Morgan-Armstrong, said: "It's about reducing reoffending and it's about improving the futu

The BBC has also learned that some candidates have been offering bribes of up to $1.3m (£1m) to secure votes.
Indirect elections have been taking place since October as the country remains too unsafe for a national vote.
Much of the country is still under the control of Islamist militant group al-Shabab, which is affiliated to al-Qaeda.
Gen Nur told the BBC Somali Service that some seats should be re-run because money had been used to "out-manoeuvre" other candidates, in some cases, meaning all but one candidate had withdrawn.
Cases of government resources being used in the election have also been documented, he said.
The elections are being funded by the United Nations which also supports the government based in the capital, Mogadishu.

"I'd like to thank ITV, Simon [Cowell], The X Factor family and particularly the viewers, all of whom have been a big part of my life for so long."
The 41-year-old took over from Kate Thornton in 2007 as host of the popular talent show.
The presenter and broadcaster currently presents a show on Radio 2 and recently completed a 24-hour dance challenge for Comic Relief.
"I'd like to wish the team all the best for the future, especially whoever takes over from me," O'Leary continued.
"You're about to be the conductor on the most brilliant, runaway train in showbiz. Good luck you'll love it!"
The news of his departure may fuel speculation that O'Leary is a contender to replace Jeremy Clarkson on the BBC's Top Gear.
Before Friday's announcement, William Hill had O'Leary as 6-1 to take over following the BBC's decision not to renew Clarkson's contract earlier this week.
Before The X Factor, O'Leary hosted Big Brother's Little Brother, Channel 4's companion show to its long-running reality show.
He has presented on BBC Radio 2 since 2004 and has hosted the National Television Awards since 2010.
Bookmakers Ladbrokes have made singer Olly Murs, a former X Factor runner-up, favourite to take over the vacant presenting role.
A spokesman for ITV said O'Leary had been "a fantastic host of The X Factor" and that the channel was "sorry to see him go".
"We wish him all the very best for the future and hope that he'll be back on ITV screens soon."
---Sum/Tgt: Dermot O'Leary will no longer host ITV's The X Factor after eight years on the programme.

===Input Doc/Src: The New Syrian Army (NSA) said it had captured a number of IS positions on the outskirts of Albu Kamal, after overrunning a nearby military airport.
However, a raid into the town launched at dawn is reported to have been repelled by militants.
The offensive, which began on Tuesday, is aimed at cutting a key route between IS-controlled areas in Syria and Iraq.
The NSA said it was co-ordinating the assault with Iraqi government forces, who were advancing on the border from the other side.
Several hundred rebels are reportedly involved in the attack on Albu Kamal, just a few kilometres from the Iraqi border in Deir al-Zour province.
The NSA and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, both said on Wednesday morning that the rebels had taken control of Hamdan airport, about 5km (3 miles) north-west of the town.
Fighting was continuing between the two sides in agricultural areas around the town, and coalition warplanes were conducting air strikes on IS hideouts in the town, according to the Syrian Observatory.
NSA spokesman Mozahem al-Saloum told the Associated Press that airborne fighters had also been dropped onto the southern edge of Albu Kamal.
Later on Wednesday, the NSA issued a statement saying its forces had "conducted a deep penetration raid" into Albu Kamal.
"At this time fighting is still ongoing, but the NSA maintains control of the desert, the approaches to Albu Kamal, and maintains freedom of manoeuvre," it added.
The Reuters news agency cited two rebel sources as saying that the NSA had been forced to retreat to the outskirts after an IS counter-attack.
One of the sources said militants had encircled the rebels in a surprise ambush. The rebels had incurred heavy casualties and lost some of their weapons, the source added.
As the rebels advanced on Albu Kamal, IS released a video showing militants beheading five young men in the town who they claimed were working with the NSA, the Syrian Observatory said.

===Input Doc/Src: The Belfast women alleged they were abused over a three-year period in the late 1990s, when they were teenagers.
They claim the case was delayed because prosecutors gave precedence to a separate court case, involving allegations made by MÃ¡iria Cahill.
The PPS said the decision had been made by the court and not them.
The women said they had been "utterly let down by the criminal justice system".
Both women, who have retained their right to anonymity, released a statement through their solicitor, outlining the background to their case and the delays they faced in bringing the matter to court.
The two women said they first reported the alleged abuse to the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) in January 2010.
They said their case was "constantly adjourned" and then postponed two days before the trial was due to begin.
In November 2012, the women's legal representatives made complaints about the handling of the prosecution case to the Public Prosecution Service (PPS), the Office of Attorney General and the Department of Justice.
The solicitor said that shortly after a meeting with police and prosecutors in December 2012, during which there was a "frank exchange of views", the two women "reluctantly withdrew their statements".
The statement issued on behalf of two women said: "They had lost all faith and trust in the criminal justice system and believed they were being exploited, merely for political point scoring."
The statement also made reference to appointment of Keir Starmer QC to lead an independent review of three prosecution cases linked to Ms Cahill's allegations.
The women questioned the independence of the review and called for clarification on its powers and terms of reference.
Five people accused in connection with the cases linked to Ms Cahill's allegations were all acquitted in court.

===Input Doc/Src: The Ministry of the Defence (MoD) has had a tracking station on the isle since 1957.
It is linked to a missile range controlled from a military site on Benbecula in the Western Isles.
The National Trust for Scotland, which manages St Kilda along with the MoD, said the planned new buildings were "sympathetic and sustainable".
St Kilda lies about 40 miles (64km) west of North Uist, the nearest inhabited place to the archipelago.
The last islanders left St Kilda in 1930 and people only now live on Hirta on a temporary basis to work at the military site, or on wildlife conservation projects.
The MoD, working with its defence contractors QinetiQ and Skye-based architects Wittets, has submitted a planning application to Western Isles local authority, Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, for a redevelopment and environmental upgrading of its 50-year-old St Kilda facilities.
Galliford Try International and Hugh Broughton Architects have been appointed to develop the design of the new buildings.

Lower parts of the new buildings would be "curtained" with stone walls designed to blend into the St Kildan landscape.

===Input Doc/Src: But is it possible dragons could ever exist beyond the pages of Celtic mythology or the celluloid of fantasy film?
Academics have suggested in a recent essay the creation of large, winged dragons using cutting-edge genome editing is not beyond the realms of possibility.
Is the seemingly far-fetched idea a flier or, like dragon's breath, just hot air? The BBC asked the authors.
The essay in The American Journal of Bioethics said spectacular animals could be brought to life using a targeted gene-editing system known as CRISPR-CAS9.
Co-authors Prof Hank T Greely, director of the Centre for Law and the Biosciences at Stanford Law School, and Prof R Alta Charo, Professor of Bioethics and Law at Wisconsin Law School, said their dragon suggestion was "somewhat tongue-in-cheek" but "not impossible".
"There are the possibilities of spectacles," they wrote. "Animals and plants not created for personal use but to be exhibited.
"Consider, for example, the dragon. Basic physics will almost certainly combine with biological constraints to prevent the creation of flying or fire-breathing dragons.
"But a very large reptile that looks at least somewhat like the European or Asian dragon (perhaps with flappable if not flyable wings) could be someone's target of opportunity."
And it may not be as improbable as it seems at first blush.
CRISPR and other similar techniques involve DNA being inserted, replaced, or removed from a genome using artificially engineered nucleases.
The method has been adopted by scientists around the world.
CRISPRs (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) are sections of DNA, while CAS-9 (CRISPR-associated protein 9) is an enzyme.
They are found in bacteria, which use them to disable attacks from viruses.
They have led to the creation of patented "GloFish" that shine under UV light, the eradication of horns from certain cattle species, manipulation of crops and attempts to produce hypo-allergenic cats.

===Input Doc/Src: Cezary Sobiewski, 40, murdered Barbara Baraniecka weeks after she confided concerns about his drinking to friends.
A judge said Sobiewski went to buy cider after the "sustained and brutal attack" at the couple's home in Tipton, West Midlands.
Sobiewski admitted Ms Baraniecka's murder on Monday.
He entered the plea on what would have been the start of his trial at Wolverhampton Crown Court.
Updates on this and other stories in Birmingham and the Black Country
The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said Ms Baraniecka had told Sobiewski she wanted to end their relationship last October, a month before her death.
She had already confided in friends she had concerns about his increased alcohol consumption.
Police said Sobiewski, who had moved to the UK from the US in 2010 to live with Ms Baraniecka, was arrested at the scene.
Her 25-year-old daughter found her covered in blood on her bed as Sobiewski sat in the kitchen.
Paramedics confirmed she had been dead for several hours.
Sentencing him, Judge John Wait said: "Having killed Barbara Baraniecka in the course of a sustained and brutal attack, you went out to the supermarket, bought cider and sat at home drinking it, leaving Barbara's daughter to find her mother's body and call the emergency services.
"You took the life of someone who had many friends and who was the mother of two daughters."
Speaking after Sobiewski's guilty plea on Monday, Det Insp Jim Munro said: "I very much hope that now this case is over, it will in some small way allow Barbara's daughters to start rebuilding their lives after the terrible events of November last year."
"Cezary Sobiewski could not control his drinking or his jealousy and his actions have resulted in the death of a completely innocent woman."
---Sum/Tgt: A "jealous" man who stabbed his partner 13 times because he could not accept their relationship was over will serve a minimum of 20 years in prison.

===Input Doc/Src: Three separate experts say Tata made the cash by selling carbon emissions permits it was given for free.
They say Tata was allocated more carbon allowances under the EU emissions trading scheme (EUETS) than it needed.
There is no suggestion Tata broke the rules, and the firm said its permits were a "matter of public record".
Reports say Tata profited more than any other firm in the UK from the much-criticised trading scheme, which allowed it to sell the surplus to other firms wanting permits to pollute.
Other windfalls allegedly went to Lafarge, Hanson, and Total UK.
But the analysis is controversial because some climate sceptics blamed EU climate policies for the demise of Tata.
One report - by consultants CE Delft for citizens' group Carbon Market Watch - shows that the ailing steel firm was the UK's biggest beneficiary of the EUETS windfall, making £704m.
Overall it says industry across Europe has earned a £19bn windfall from 2008 to 2014.
Tata declined to comment on the specific figures, but said it disagreed with the methodology used in the reports for calculating its profits from the EUETS.
It said the allegations were a "selective telling of the many flaws in the EUETS."
A spokesman told BBC News: "We agree that the current emissions trading system needs to be fixed and all parties should focus on how best this can be done, rather than conducting theoretical studies on what it could have previously meant for individual companies."
The problem happened because when the EUETS began national governments were left to decide how many carbon permits their industries needed to cushion themselves from foreign competition.
The governments typically allocated more permits than necessary because it cost them nothing directly, whilst boosting domestic firms.
The sectors profiting most from pollution payouts have been iron and steel, cement, refineries and petrochemicals.
One report says the amount netted by industry over the period is more than 10 times the amount the EU

===Input Doc/Src: The 28 prefabricated homes will provide emergency housing for people who would otherwise be forced to stay in bed and breakfast accommodation.
Reading Borough Council said it had about 120 families staying in guest houses at the end of 2016.
Work begins in Lowfield Road on Tuesday with the first residents due to arrive in the autumn.
The development, on the site of a former mobile home park, will consist of seven timber-clad blocks of four units, two storeys high, a children's play area, car parking and bike sheds.
Each unit will have two bedrooms, a bathroom, kitchen-diner and a living room.
The 28 homes are intended to house homeless families while they are waiting for authority-owned or housing association accommodation to become available.
Legally councils can house families in temporary accommodation for a maximum of six weeks.
The council said the stock of affordable housing in Reading had reduced because of high land prices and rents, as well as right-to-buy sales.
Housing councillor Richard Davies said: "Reading, along with many other towns and cities in the region, has seen an increase in the number of families requiring emergency housing.
"This has resulted in the council being forced to use bed and breakfast accommodation which is unsuitable and disruptive for homeless families."

===Input Doc/Src: Under the rules, racegoers will also have to wear skirts or dresses of "modest length" falling just above the knee or longer.
For men, a waistcoat and tie will be compulsory in the enclosure and cravats will not be allowed.
Organisers said the decision was part of a move to restore formality.
The annual week-long event in June attracts about 300,000 visitors each year.
The popularity for elaborate fascinators, which are a cross between a hair accessory and a mini hat, continued last year after the Duchess of Cambridge wore a feathered one on her first official engagement in Anglesey.
In the less formal grandstand, which is open to the public, it will now be compulsory for women to wear a hat or fascinator.
In previous years, when female racegoers were simply advised that "many ladies wear hats".
Strapless or sheer-strap tops and dresses will also be banned.
For men, a suit and tie will now be obligatory.
Ascot spokesman Nick Smith said: "It is probably fair to say the dress code hasn't necessarily been enforced quite as rigorously as we might have liked.
"There is no doubt our customers would like to get back to a situation where it is universally acknowledged this is a formal occasion and not an occasion where you might dress as you would at a nightclub."
Charles Barnett, Ascot's chief executive, said the intention was to be "as helpful as possible" to visitors and to help racegoers in understanding what is "cherished" about the dress code at Royal Ascot.
"It isn't a question of elitism and not being modern in a world where there is less and less requirement to dress smartly - far from it," he said.
"We want to see modern and stylish dress at Royal Ascot, just within the parameters of formal wear."
The less formal Silver Ring will not be affected by the changes.
---Sum/Tgt: Women will have to wear hats, not fascinators, as part of a tightening of the dress code in Royal Ascot's Royal Enclosure this summer.

===Input Doc/Src: Louise Wright, from Mapperley, died after she was hit by a lorry in Nottingham city centre earlier this month.
A bike which has been painted white, known as a ghost bike, has been left at the scene along with floral tributes.
Her partner James Faulkner said he hoped it would promote cycle safety.
Ms Wright, who worked for fashion firm Paul Smith, died on 3 July after the crash involving an HGV in Lower Parliament Street.
The ghost bike, thought to be the first in the East Midlands, appeared recently along with tributes to the popular 29-year-old.
Mr Faulkner said he and Ms Wright's family had taken comfort from many well-wishers' kind words.
"We still don't know the circumstances of the accident yet, but I hope that the ghost bike will help raise awareness of cyclists on the roads," he said.
"If it can help prevent any future accidents, then it will have served a purpose and could help save a life."
Tributes were also paid to Ms Wright on Facebook, including by the Nottingham Roller Girls roller derby team who described her as beautiful, vibrant and funny.
Mike Hallam, duty manager at business Machine Mart next to the crash scene, said some people had reservations about the memorial.
"I dare say most people were touched but there were a few mixed reactions, whether it was tasteless or not," he said.
"Personally I think it was a very good idea."
Leaving a white bike at the scene of a fatal crash started in the United States but has been a growing phenomena across the UK over the last few years.

===Input Doc/Src: As the victims struggle with the misery of damage, mud and ruin, officials say we have entered an era of "unknown extremes" of weather and they want a "complete rethink" of how flooding is handled.
Some aspects of the response are infinitely improved from earlier disasters. The emergency teams from organisations as diverse as the fire brigades, the RNLI and the police are far better co-ordinated than they used to be.
In Carlisle earlier this month, I saw one mountain rescue team, well-equipped with an inflatable boat, ropes, torches and radios, inch through deep water in total darkness to carefully and tenderly deliver a frightened woman to safety.
But however professional the response, questions are inevitably raised about why this effort is needed in the first place, with people demanding to know why their communities were not better defended.
And that leads to a sense of anger that as victims of flooding feel ignored or let down by the authorities for failing to keep them safe.
I first witnessed this during the summer of 2007 in Hull, where thousands of families were displaced by floods with some still in temporary housing a year later.
One family I interviewed were incensed at the prospect of facing a second Christmas in a chilly caravan.
Earlier this month, residents in Carlisle, who had watched the construction of a £38m flood-defence scheme just five years before, reacted with fury as it was overtopped by rising waters.
We have heard anger too from Leeds City Council which, like many northern authorities, believes that Whitehall favours the South when it comes to allocating funds for flood defence - though the government insists that the North does better on a per capita basis.
And anger has been voiced in York in the past few days as the Environment Agency made a fateful decision to lift the Foss Barrier, a key part of the city's flood defence system.
With the barrier's electrical motors at risk of flooding - something which itself will face investigation -

===Input Doc/Src: Pakistan accused India of unprovoked firing in which four civilians died and five others were injured.
India said one woman was killed and three other civilians wounded in firing by Pakistani soldiers.
Pakistan's army also said it shot down an Indian spy drone in Kashmir.
Pakistan summoned the Indian ambassador on Thursday to hear a "strong protest over airspace violation", the AFP news agency quoting a statement issued by the Pakistani foreign ministry said.
The incidents come days after Mr Modi accepted an invitation from Mr Sharif to attend a regional summit in Islamabad next year, signalling a new thaw in a strained relationship. This will be Mr Modi's first visit to Pakistan after he took power last year.
India and Pakistan have often accused each other of unprovoked firing along the disputed border. A ceasefire agreed in 2003 remains in place, but the neighbours often accuse each other of violating it.
Pakistan's military said four civilians, including a 18-year-old girl, had died and five others were wounded when Indian troops fired across the de facto border in Sialkot region on Wednesday morning.
Across the border, Indian border guards said one woman had been killed and three other civilians injured when Pakistani soldiers fired shells which exploded near a border village in Pargwal area on Wednesday.
"It was a blatant, unprovoked cease-fire violation by Pakistan," D Parekh of India's Border Security Force told the Associated Press news agency.
Meanwhile, India's army and air force have denied that any of their drones had been shot down or crashed in Pakistan, reports said.
"An Indian spy drone was shot down by Pakistani troops which intruded into Pakistan along [the de facto border that divides the region] near Bhimber today. The spy drone is used for aerial photography," a statement from the Pakistani military said on Wednesday.

Skondras joined PAOK from Atromitos in 2013 and has made 94 appearances for the Thessaloniki-based club.
But he has not played at all this season after Vladimir Ivic took over as head coach.
Skondras is unlikely to receive international clearance in time to play for Hamilton in Tuesday's Scottish Premiership game against Inverness Caledonian Thistle.
The defender, who has played for PAOK in the Champions League and Europa League, becomes the second player to sign for a Scottish club on Monday after leaving PAOK.
Former team-mate Alexandros Tziolis, the Greece midfielder,  joined Hearts until the end of the season.
Accies player-manager Martin Canning is also on the look-out for a striker but says he may have to leave it late as Tuesday's 23:00 GMT transfer deadline looms.
"I'm still speaking to a couple of strikers that I'd like to get in, but they will be last minute things if they end up going through," he said.
However, he does not expect to be waving goodbye to top scorer Ali Crawford any time soon.
The midfielder has nine goals this season but missed a glorious chance to put Hamilton in front against St Johnstone on Saturday in a game Accies went on to lose 3-0 in Perth.
And his boss reckons he will need to start putting those kind of opportunities away if he wants to make a move to a bigger club.
"There has been literally no-one contacting the club about Ali," said Canning.
"I think his agent has asked how much we would accept for him, but that's the only question that has ever been put to us.
"Hopefully that opportunity will come for Ali, but he has got to keep his head down and continue to work hard and, if you look at Saturday's game, take the chances that will put him in the spotlight.

===Input Doc/Src: It emerged with the help of Iran during the Israeli occupation of Lebanon in the early 1980s, though its ideological roots stretch back to the Shia Islamic revival in Lebanon in the 1960s and '70s.
After Israel withdrew in 2000, Hezbollah resisted pressure to disarm and continued to strengthen its military wing, the Islamic Resistance. In some ways, its capabilities now exceed those of the Lebanese army, its considerable firepower used against Israel in the 2006 war.
The group also gradually became a key power broker in Lebanon's political system, and has effectively gained veto power in the cabinet.
Hezbollah has been accused of carrying out a string of bombings and plots against Jewish and Israeli targets and is designated a terrorist organisation by Western states, Israel, Gulf Arab countries and the Arab League.
Some Lebanese consider Hezbollah a threat to the country's stability, but it is enduringly popular within the Shia community.
Hezbollah's precise origins are difficult to pinpoint, but its precursors emerged following the Israeli invasion of South Lebanon in response to attacks by Palestinian militants in 1982, when Shia leaders favouring a militant response broke away from the leading Amal movement.
The new organisation, Islamic Amal, received considerable military and organisational support from Iran's Revolutionary Guards based in the Bekaa Valley, and emerged as the most prominent and effective of the Shia militias that would later form Hezbollah.
The groups launched attacks on the Israeli military and its ally, the South Lebanon Army (SLA), as well as foreign powers in Lebanon. They are believed to have been behind the bombings of the US embassy and US Marine barracks in 1983, which together left 258 Americans and 58 French servicemen dead, and led Western peacekeeping forces to withdraw.

The Guardian said the "parasitic space alien has returned for this watchable if unoriginal sci-fi thriller".
But The Telegraph said the film was "grandiose" and "exhilarating".
"To want more Alien after this... would be to want to see something very odd indeed," Robbie Collin continued. "But Covenant leaves the mythos feeling riper and more vitalised than ever."
In The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw went on to say: "The vu has never been so deja: It's a greatest-hits compilation of the other Alien films' freaky moments.
"The paradox is that though you are intended to recognise these touches, you won't really be impressed unless you happen to be seeing them for the first time."
The Independent described it as a "mightily impressive piece of cinematic engineering".
"Every second here is tinged with dark foreboding, with the relentless tension that marked the 1979 original," the paper's Clarisse Loughrey said.
The Mirror was equally effusive, saying: "Scott's final theatrical flourish sends the franchise spinning out in a new direction. This is screamingly great cinema."
In the US, where the movie comes out on 19 May, Variety magazine was firmly on the fence, saying the film was "more of the same, which is both a relief to fans and a letdown to those hoping it might pave new ground".
Its reviewer Peter Debruge concluded: "As acts of creation go, Scott has made an Alien movie for that segment of the audience that has always rooted for the monster."
In the Hollywood Reporter, the verdict was considerably more enthusiastic, saying the film was "gripping through its full two hours and spiked with some real surprises".
"This beautifully made sci-fi thriller will immeasurably boost fan interest in the run of prequels which Scott has recently said will consist of at least two more films until the action catches up to the 1979 original," 
---Sum/Tgt: Ridley Scott's return to directing a film in the Alien franchise has received mixed reviews ahead of its UK and US release.

===Input Doc/Src: This is their first major operation in CAR since about 150 troops were deployed in recent weeks to Bangui, amid warnings of a genocide.
Around a quarter of CAR's 4.6 million population have fled their homes since conflict erupted in March 2013 between mainly Muslim and Christian militias.
The African Union and France have about 7,000 troops in the country.
They have been battling to curb the conflict, and the EU has pledged to send up to 1,000 troops and the United Nations (UN) about 12,000 troops.
French troops handed control of the airport in the capital, Bangui, to the EU force on Wednesday.
Bangui has seen some of the worst fighting, and AU troops escorted more than 1,200 Muslims out of the city on Sunday to protect them from the mainly Christian anti-balaka militia.
The EU force is under the command of a French officer, Maj-Gen Philippe Ponties, and is made up of French and Estonian troops.
Source: Index Mundi
Their deployment to the airport is intended to allow French troops to move elsewhere in the country.
UN officials and aid agencies have warned that hatred between Christians and Muslims could lead to a genocide and the partition of the country.
Few Muslims remain in Bangui, with most of them fleeing to the north or neighbouring states.
Christians form the majority in CAR, and the anti-balaka say they took up arms after coming under attack from the mainly Muslim Seleka rebels who seized power in March 2013.
Seleka leader Michel Djotodia was forced to step down in January, because of his failure to stem the violence.
He had been the CAR's first Muslim ruler. His supporters accuse troops loyal to the president he overthrew, Francois Bozize, of fuelling the conflict.
---Sum/Tgt: European Union (EU) troops have taken control of security at the Central African Republic's (CAR) main airport.

===Input Doc/Src: The Office for National Statistics said there were 3.5 million such households in the UK between April and June this year, about 17.1% of all households including a working age adult.
This was down from 3.7 million, or 17.9%, a year earlier.
The highest percentage of workless households was in north-east England.
Some 23% of households including a working age adult were workless in the region. The lowest was in south-east England, where 13% of households were in this category.
Workless households are defined as homes where no-one aged from 16 to 64 is in employment. This could be because they are looking for work, or they have chosen not to work, or they are unable to work.
People may choose not to work because of family commitments, early retirement or study. They may be unable to work because of sickness or disability.
The data shows that the number of workless households in the UK dropped by 182,000 over the year.
This means that 4.9 million people aged 16 to 64 lived in workless households. The ONS said this was the first time the figure had dropped below five million since 2008.
Some 14% of all children in the UK, or 1.6 million, were living in these households. About two-thirds of them were in single-parent households.
Children's charities - Barnardo's and The Children's Society - said they welcomed the fact that the number of children living in workless households was falling.
However, a move into work did not necessarily mean a move out of poverty, they argued.
They said it was imperative for the government to reduce childcare costs for families on low incomes.
The proportion of workless households was at its highest in 1996, when comparable records began, when it stood at 20.9% in the UK. This fell steadily to 17.3% in 2006 before rising to 19.2% in 2010. It has fallen relatively sharply in the past three years.
In 2013, there were 297,000 households in which no adult has ever worked, down 43,000 on the previous year. If student households are excluded, thi
---Sum/Tgt: The proportion of UK households where no adult aged 16 to 64 is in work is at its lowest since comparable records began in 1996, official figures show.

===Input Doc/Src: An estimated 250 people made the journey from Wales to the holy city of Mecca, near where the incident happened on Thursday.
The Muslim Council of Wales (MCW) had difficultly contacting some groups from Cardiff, Newport and Swansea.
All have now confirmed they are safe.
MCW general secretary Saleem Kidwai said he had made contact with all group leaders from Wales, and all those on the pilgrimages have been accounted for.
The MCW's director of projects Mohammed Alamgir said he is now ensuring adequate support services are available to the returning parties through its network of chaplains and Imams.
"There was great concern for families and many members of the Welsh Muslim community waited anxiously for news of their loved ones and friends. Prayers were offered across Wales hoping for good news," he said on Sunday.
"We all now wait for the outcome of the investigation launched by the Saudi government and hope for further safeguards to ensure the safety of pilgrims."
Along with those killed, a further 863 people were injured in the incident at Mina, which happened as two million pilgrims were taking part in the Hajj's last major rite.

===Input Doc/Src: BT is paying the money to Deutsche Telekom and Orange to avoid legal action over the issue.
The two companies now hold stakes in BT as a consequence of the deal that saw them sell the EE mobile network to the UK company.
The charge led to BT's first-quarter profits falling 42% to £418m.
In January, BT wrote down the value of its Italian unit by £530m after it said it had uncovered years of "inappropriate behaviour".
It said it had found evidence of improper accounting practices, leading to "the overstatement of earnings in our Italian business over a number of years".
The Financial Reporting Council (FRC), the UK's accountancy watchdog, is investigating the auditing of BT's financial statements for the years 2015-17.
Separately, BT announced that Marc Allera had been appointed as chief executive of its combined BT consumer business, while Cathryn Ross - currently chief executive of Ofwat - will become its new director of regulatory affairs.

The midfielder agreed personal terms with the Canaries this week and, having passed his medical, he has penned a three-and-a-half-year deal.
"He can add goals to our midfield, which I think we need," said Norwich manager Paul Lambert.
"He'll get better as a player the higher the level he goes up. If he does that he'll be a great player for us."
Former England Under-21 international Howson, a product of the Leeds academy, has made almost 200 appearances since his debut in 2006, but his contract was due to expire in the summer.
He has featured 22 times for his home town club this season, although he has not played since picking up a knee injury in the 2-0 win over Millwall at the beginning of December.
Meanwhile, Lambert has outlined a back injury as the reason for terminating the season-long loan of Manchester United defender Ritchie de Laet five months early.
The 23-year-old Belgian has played seven times for the Canaries, but has not featured since the 2-0 Premier League loss to Tottenham on 27 December.
"Ritchie's done great for us," said Lambert. "But he has a back injury which was keeping him out for periods of time."

===Input Doc/Src: Mike Petter quit his post ahead of the publication, due on Friday, of a Care Quality Commission (CQC) report on Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust.
He said leaving his post had been a "very difficult decision".
Problems came to light at the trust when 18-year-old Connor Sparrowhawk drowned in a bath at a care facility.
An inquest found neglect contributed his death, at Slade House in Oxford, in 2013.
A report commissioned by NHS England, published in December 2015, discovered that only 272 of the 722 deaths in the trust over the previous four years were investigated.
The trust was issued a warning notice by the CQC following an inspection in January.
In a statement Mr Petter said: "The trust has recently undergone a significant amount of scrutiny in some service areas and, given the challenges it faces, I feel it is appropriate for me to allow new board leadership to take forward the improvements.
"I have been involved in Southern Health since the trust was formed in 2011 as a non-executive director and since August 2015 as chairman.

===Input Doc/Src: His inclusion in the England Lions squad for the January tour of South Africa is great news, coming on the back of what have perhaps been England's most difficult few weeks of the entire period.
Trott has fought very hard to get into this position. When he first left Australia with what were later clarified as anxiety issues, many thought that his England career was over.
When his first attempt at a comeback was aborted in April, I was told by someone close to the Warwickshire batsman that the next step would be a quiet return playing some club cricket in South Africa.
The right-hander will play in the country of his birth, but on merit after receiving recognition from the selectors as a result of a very strong second part of the summer that saw him accumulate 628 first-class runs and average 54.22 as Warwickshire reached the final of the One-Day Cup.
Because of his South African roots and the decision for Trott to only be on tour for one three-day warm-up match and two first-class four-day games against South Africa A, this trip should not hold many difficulties for him.
He will also have the help of Andy Flower, who was in charge of England in Australia and will be working with the Lions in South Africa.
The experience in Australia will have taught Flower how to spot any problems that Trott may encounter, while I am sure the Zimbabwean will make it absolutely clear that the player must report any concerns he has.
Having taken the incredibly difficult decision to go public with his problems on leaving Australia, Trott no longer has to operate in secret, or fear embarrassment. Similarly, Flower knows he can keep a close eye on Trott without the worry of over-imposing himself.
Through all of this, representing England again will be on Trott's mind. Since he last played international cricket, Alastair Cook's side have moved on, with younger players like Gary Ballance and Joe Root doing very well, but there is still room for the 33-year-old's experience, especially wit

===Input Doc/Src: The latest available figures show that during 2014 there were 16.5 suicides per 100,000 in Northern Ireland.
Scotland had the second highest rate, at 14.5, followed by 10.3 in England and 9.2 in Wales.
It is the second consecutive year that Northern Ireland has recorded the UK's highest suicide rate.
However, the overall number of suicides in Northern Ireland decreased in 2014, falling to 268 compared to 303 deaths.
This reflected a small decrease in the total number of suicides across the UK as a whole in 2014, where the overall figure fell by 2%.
Last month, the Irish News reported that since the Good Friday Agreement was signed in 1998, more people have taken their own lives in Northern Ireland than were killed during the Troubles.
Prof Siobhan O'Neill, from Ulster University' Psychology Research Institute, told the BBC there may be a link between those decades of conflict and the deaths of some of those who have taken their lives in a time of relative peace.
"Deprivation certainly is one of the legacy issues and we know that those areas that are deprived, that have high levels of deprivation, have also been the same areas that were exposed to conflict.
"Those are the areas where our suicide rates are highest," she added.
That link between deprivation and despair means that the legacy of the Troubles is having an impact on another generation in places like Londonderry.
Emma Johnston works with the charity Youth Action Northern Ireland which tries to get young people to talk about their mental health. One of the locations where she tries to help them is the job centre.
"Every programme that we deliver, at its core, at its very essence, is focusing around young people's mental health and while we may not frame it to begin with in that way, it's about raising them up, making them more resilient and maybe trying to raise their optimism for their future," she said.

===Input Doc/Src: The interim New Democracy leader, 61, represents the old way - serving for years in centre-right governments accused by the left of bringing painful austerity and institutionalised corruption.
But after months of political strain, exhaustive bailout negotiations and continued economic despair, Greece is seemingly starting to regret its flirtation with the new.
According to latest opinion polls, Mr Meimarakis is now challenging Alexis Tsipras, Greece's youngest prime minister in modern times, for first place in this month's elections.
Commentators say he is a voice of economic stability, who has successfully unified his party to make a comeback.
Born in Athens in 1953, Vangelis Meimarakis's family were from Crete and his father was an MP in the island's main city Heraklion.
He trained as a lawyer at the University of Athens, and became involved in student politics while studying public administration at Panteion University.
He was one of the founding members New Democracy's youth wing (ONNED).
First elected as an MP in 1989, he was ND's chief whip from 1991 to 1992 and served as defence minister from 2006 to 2009.
He is married to Joanna Kolokota, daughter of Greek actress Nitsa Marouda, and they have two daughters.
Mr Meimarakis became speaker of the Greek parliament in 2012, briefly standing down that year amid a corruption scandal involving an inquiry into money laundering allegation.
He strongly denied any wrongdoing and returned to his position soon after, remaining as speaker until early 2015.
A strong supporter of keeping Greece in the eurozone, Mr Meimarakis was appointed interim leader of New Democracy in July 2015 after the resignation of Antonis Samaras.
Mr Samaras stepped down after voters backed Mr Tsipras in a bailout referendum by a bigger-than-expected margin.
New Democracy looked fragile - without the figurehead who had led the party for six years, and trailing Syriza by a wide margin in the opinion polls.
But a few months later, its fortunes seem to

He is suspected to be second-in-command in the Jalisco New Generation cartel, led by his father Nemesio.
The gang is blamed for killing at least 20 police officers in March-April and May's shooting down of an army helicopter in which 10 people died.
Mr Oseguera Gonzalez, known as El Menchito, was arrested in Zapopan, near Guadalajara, the authorities said. No shots were fired.
This is the second time that he has been captured.
He was arrested in January 2014, but was released later that year for lack of evidence.
Mr Oseguera Gonzalez is suspected of controlling the cartel's finances and of buying drugs from South American countries.
The Jalisco New Generation cartel is involved in large-scale drug trafficking along Mexico's Pacific Coast.
It has recently increased its presence in the area, with Jalisco and the neighbouring Michoacan among Mexico's most violent states.
The Jalisco New Generation is also engaged in a turf war with the Knights Templar cartel.
Tens of thousands of people have been killed in drug-related violence in Mexico over the past eight years.

"Walter Mazzarri's Watford look destined for another creditable mid-table finish, but that's unlikely to earn the Italian an invitation to stay a second season.
"Mazzarri is the eighth manager employed by the Pozzo family since their ownership of the club began in 2012, and has been wise enough not to invest too much time in learning English.
"A pat on the back and a pay-off is probably what Mazzarri expects in the summer. That is unless Watford should slump between now and May - in which case he can forget the pat on the back."

Dumfries and Galloway Council's licensing panel is being asked to issue permission for both events.
However, a parish priest in Dumfries has objected to the march saying it has "no reason whatsoever, historical or otherwise" to be held in the town.
The council has to be consulted by anyone wishing to hold any public procession.
The Locharbriggs Loyal Orange Lodge wants to stage one march through Dumfries at 15:30 on Saturday 4 March lasting for about 45 minutes.
It would follow a route along New Abbey Road, Laurieknowe, Galloway Street, Buccleuch Street, High Street, Shakespeare Street and Nith Place before ending at the Dock Park.
The second procession - starting at 18:00 - would take place for about half an hour through Locharbriggs.
It has been estimated that 75 people would take part in the Dumfries procession and 50 people in the Locharbriggs one.
Fr Jim Hayes of St Teresa's RC church has made a representation against the marches.

The carefully considered on-air interviews with Gerry Adams and Raymond McCartney on the distressing case of Mr McGahon were undermined by a tweet from Francie Molloy.
The Mid Ulster MP described the Spotlight programme as "another load of rubbish".
Mr Molloy's subsequent apology and deletion of his tweet doesn't expunge the impression that many republicans would prefer it if victims like Paudie McGahon and Mairia Cahill had obeyed the IRA's initial orders by  maintaining their silence.
Expect more discussion about the development of some kind of north-south process to examine the cover-up of abuse during the Troubles and the movement of abusers across the border or across the Irish Sea.
Fianna Fail's Micheál Martin wants "a cross-border mechanism to at least facilitate other victims to come forward, who might not want to go public".
Rather than being the party in the dock, Sinn Féin has tried to seize the initiative by advocating an "all-island process to deal with the issue of providing support mechanisms for all those who were victims of sexual abuse during the conflict".
Micheál Martin is dismissive of the Sinn Féin suggestion, arguing in the Dáil (Irish parliament) that it had been developed by republicans "just to dilute your culpability".
Northern Ireland's Justice Minister David Ford and his Irish counterpart Frances Fitzgerald are wary of sanctioning any process that might cut across investigations or reviews already under way involving the Garda (Irish police), the Police Ombudsman or the former DPP, Keir Starmer.

===Input Doc/Src: The team tracked the health of nearly 800 villagers from the Chianti region of Italy to see if their local tipple had any discernable impact.
They found no proof that the wine ingredient resveratrol stops heart disease or prolongs life.
Experts say more research is needed to get a definitive answer.
The British Heart Foundation is carrying out its own resveratrol study.
Many studies have sought to explain why there is a low incidence of heart disease in France, despite many of its inhabitants eating a high-fat diet.
Some put it down to moderate drinking of red wine.
Studies have shown that consumption of red wine, dark chocolate and berries reduces inflammation, leading researchers to speculate that their common ingredient, resveratrol, explains why.
But Prof Richard Semba, of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and colleagues found no evidence for this.
They chose two small towns in Tuscany as their test ground, and 783 elderly people who were living there agreed to take part in their investigation.
The volunteers gave details about their daily diets as well as urine samples for measurement of their resveratrol intake.
During the nine years of the study, 268 of the men and women died, 174 developed heart disease and 34 got cancer.
But urinary resveratrol was not linked with death risk, heart disease risk or cancer risk.
Nor was it associated with any markers of inflammation in the blood, the researchers report in JAMA Internal Medicine.

===Input Doc/Src: A total of 58% (1.8m) give Christianity as their belief, a 14% drop since 2001, a larger fall than any English region.
But a total of 32% in Wales said they had no religion, the highest total was in Blaenau Gwent with 41.1%; the lowest in Flintshire with 25.4%.
The Church in Wales said Christianity is "no longer the default setting" for many people but the picture is complex.
A quarter of the population in Wales and England as a whole said they have no religion.
This was a rise of 10% from 15% (7.7 million) in 2001 to 14.1 million in 2011.
Census: Key Welsh data on religion
But the proportion in Wales with no religion was higher than across Wales and England as a whole.
Those stating that they were Muslim in Wales is 1.5% - up from 0.7% - with the highest proportion in Cardiff (6.8%) and Newport (4.7%).
There were also slight increases in the percentage of people who said they were Hindu or Buddhist - both up from 0.2% to 0.3%.
There was also a rise in people saying they had other faiths - from 0.2% to 0.4%
The percentage who said they were Sikh or Jewish remained unchanged between 2001 and 2011 at 0.1%.
The Church in Wales said the figures show that Christianity "is no longer the default setting it once was for many people in Wales".
But a spokeswoman added that the reasons were complex.
"Today we find people go to church because they want to, not because they feel they have to or because it's the place to see and be seen," she said.
"It should also be borne in mind that statistics can't show the whole picture in matters of faith.
"The past few months, for example, have seen people in different parts of Wales turn to churches in their thousands following various tragic events: in Machynlleth, in Ely, in St Asaph.
"People find God when life gets tough and it is the Church's privilege to be there for them whenever and wherever we may be needed."

===Input Doc/Src: However, only a fraction of those affected may receive compensation.
Legal filings indicated that 250,000 people had lost some Â£130m in benefits.
The Court of Appeal suggested the Department for Work and Pensions would owe a mere 1% of that amount, Â£1.3m, to just 2,500 people.
The complex judgment on Friday was originally prompted by a challenge from Cait Reilly, a geology graduate from Birmingham.
She had argued that requiring her to work at Poundland for no pay constituted a breach of her human rights.
The government - to counter such claims - had retrospectively altered the law to validate the docking of benefits.
Today, the Court of Appeal ruled that even under that new revised law, the docking of benefits could be incompatible with the European Convention of Human Rights.
The Court's ruling represented a defeat for the government.
Padraig Hughes, of Public Interest Lawyers, the group that brought Ms Reilly's case, said: "It is yet a further example of the reckless approach this Government continues to take towards the constitution and the rule of law."
The Court of Appeal judges did nevertheless acknowledge that government ministers can change laws to affect cases retrospectively.
And the judges decided that the only rights infringed upon where those of people that had already claimed the benefits docking was unfair.
This narrowing of the claimants explains why only a tiny fraction of people will be eligible for a payout.
"We are considering the judgment", a DWP spokesman said. "It is only right that jobseekers do all they can to find work while claiming benefits."
It is not clear yet whether either side will make a further appeal.
---Sum/Tgt: The government has lost the latest round of an extended legal battle involving the docking of benefits for jobseekers who refused to participate in unpaid back-to-work schemes.

===Input Doc/Src: That is how Mohammad Mallak, editor-in-chief of Syrian magazine Saiedet Souria, describes his colleague Naji Jerf.
"He was a smiling man, energetic. He was laughing all the timeâ€¦"
Last month, Jerf, a 38-year-old Syrian anti-Islamic State (IS) activist and journalist, was shot in broad daylight with a silenced pistol in the middle of a busy Turkish street. He was murdered in Gaziantep, a city near the Syrian border, now home to nearly 300,000 Syrians.
He was about to leave Turkey with his family for France, where he had been granted asylum. Soon after his death, Reporters Without Borders released the visa application letter Jerf wrote to the French ambassador in Turkey.
"I now live in the Turkish city of Gaziantep and my safety is more and more difficult after an increase in the threats to me and my family - above all because I am a secularist and belong to the Ismaili minority, which is targeted by the jihadis."
Jerf's journalism and activism made him a target in Syria, the reason he fled across the border to Turkey in November 2012. "Naji was one of the first people who was trying to document what is happening in Syria," says Mohammad Mallak. "The regime wanted him."
"At 2012 we began to see that our friends were being taken and got killed by the regime," he adds. "We knew that if they took a friend that they would call the family in two days to deliver his dead body."
Once in Turkey, Jerf made two anti-IS films. One of them, about IS in Aleppo, was broadcast on the Saudi-run al-Arabiya channel in September 2012, to an audience of at least 12m, according to the channel.
Mr Mallak says that after the release of this documentary, the threats against Jerf, who had two young daughters, increased.
"He was afraid. He knew that they were planning to do that. But he didn't believe they could do it. Still, he was saying that he knew that they would shoot him. One day he said, 'But I am afraid of the sound of shooting.'"

===Input Doc/Src: Addicks supporters have staged a series of protests aimed at the Belgian businessman in recent months, prompting a statement claiming some fans "want the club to fail".
"Whether you like protests or not, the fans feel they need to be heard," Powell told BBC Radio London.
"They want answers and, quite clearly, they are not getting them."
Some Charlton fans have formed a campaigning group called CARD (Coalition Against Roland Duchatelet) which is calling for the the Belgian to sell the club.
Several protests took place at their last home match against Middlesbrough including a mock funeral, beach balls being thrown onto the pitch to halt the game and a walk-out by supporters in the second half.
Last month Duchatelet, who has a network of clubs around Europe, told the South London Press he has "empathy" for the fans, but was not prepared to sell.
Powell had three stints as a player at The Valley and was manager when Duchatelet took over the club in January 2014 - only to be dismissed in March that year.
"They made the statement last week which I don't think any supporter could understand," Powell, 46, added.
"It quite clearly shows there is no synergy between the owners, the higher management and the fans.
"I don't know what will happen. I'm sure many thousands of Charlton fans would like that question to be answered.
"The only person who can answer that question in Roland Duchatelet - but he hasn't. I think it is right for him to say 'This is my plan for your football club.'"

===Input Doc/Src: The budding star, coached by Kaiser Chiefs front man Ricky Wilson, beat off stiff competition from Lucy O'Byrne to take the crown.
The 29-year-old, from Alva in Clackmannanshire, had been the bookies' favourite to win the final.
After his victory was announced, Stevie said: "I never thought this was possible."
His debut single - a cover of Lost Stars - has already been released.
He has also been asked to perform at this year's T in the Park.
The firefighter only ended up on the show after his workmates entered him.
Asked what colleagues at his fire station would think, he said: "I think they're over the moon for me because they all wanted me to go for it.
"A lot of people have saw something in me that I didn't see, and even standing up there I've still got that self-doubt and I think it's going to take a while to click in, to take in, that I've actually won The Voice 2015."
A spokesman for bookmakers Coral said: "Stevie has proved a popular winner in this year's series of The Voice as he was well backed to win the show ever since his blind audition.
"All three previous winners of The Voice have struggled in the charts but our odds suggest Stevie could have some success with his debut single and album."
Ricky Wilson said Stevie had won by simply singing the song and "connecting with people".
He added: "Stevie's a typical Scotsman. Although on paper he was the favourite all along, he still felt like the massive underdog."

Deputy team principal Claire Williams said: "It's great for us to retain someone of Paul's experience."
Di Resta will combine F1 duties with racing for Mercedes in Germany's DTM touring car series.
He said he was "delighted" to stay at Williams and "looking forward to understanding the new regulations" introduced to F1 this season in an attempt to make the cars faster, more dramatic and more appealing to the audience.
Williams' new car will be revealed to the public on Friday before pre-season testing starts in Spain on 27 February.
Di Resta's best race results in F1 have been two fourth places in Singapore in 2012 and Bahrain in 2013. He was the DTM champion for Mercedes in 2010.
Part of his responsibilities at Williams will involve helping Brazilian veteran Massa, 35, support Stroll, an 18-year-old Canadian rookie who brings financial backing reported to be at least £20m to the team.
Massa retired at the end of last season but was persuaded to come back for one final year after Mercedes approached Williams to release Valtteri Bottas to them following world champion Nico Rosberg's retirement.

===Input Doc/Src: Dave Hartnett, who was head of tax at HM Revenue & Customs, said: "I'd always expected there to be be more."
Mr Hartnett, who left HMRC in 2012, was giving evidence to the Commons Public Accounts Committee.
HSBC has come under fire over what it knew about some clients' tax affairs.
Details of some 30,000 accounts at HSBC's Geneva-based private bank were leaked to the French authorities by a whistleblower, Herve Falciani, in 2007.
Information about 3,600 UK account holders were passed to HMRC.
Both HSBC and HMRC have been accused of not doing enough to investigate if these accounts were held for the purposes of tax evasion rather than legitimate avoidance.
Mr Hartnett told the committee: "I'd like to understand why there weren't more criminal prosecutions. I'd always expected there to be more. I'd have liked to understand what would have happened if  more resources were diverted to [investigating the leaked details]."
He said there were discussions with the French authorities before the leaked information was passed to the UK, and there were also discussions with HSBC. But he never got involved in the detail, "to pressure the integrity of the investigations taking place".
But HMRC tax assurance commissioner Edward Troup insisted that his department had been "diligent" in pursuing the information received from the French.
"I don't think there is anything... which suggests that we have not been diligent," he told the committee. "We have collected Â£135m. We believe we have collected all the tax, all the interest, and a significant amount of penalties."
Mr Hartnett now works for HSBC. He said that he had followed the rules for former senior officials on taking appointments outside the civil service "to the letter".
He said: "Colleagues checked it, the Cabinet Office checked it, the committee checked it, it went to the Prime Minister, and the Financial Conduct Authority also had to approve my appointment."
---Sum/Tgt: A former senior tax official has expressed "surprise" that just one person has been prosecuted in the UK over alleged tax evasion by clients of HSBC's Swiss banking division.

Eric was originally built in 1928 by Captain WH Richards and AH Reffell.
However, after he amazed crowds all over the world, Eric mysteriously disappeared - never to be seen again.
That is until 2016, when the Science Museum launched a campaign to raise money to build a copy of Eric.
Artist and robot builder Giles Walker agreed to help build the new and improved Eric.
However, the only information he had to go off were old newspaper stories, a short video from the 1920s, and a scribbled copy of the original building plans.
Instead of his old gears and pulleys, Eric is now operated by wires and motors.
It took Giles five months to build the new robot and he stands at a whopping two metres tall.
He is made from aluminium and can move his arms and head, and speak a number of phrases.
Ben Russell, who put Eric on display at the Science Museum, said: "As the UK's first robot, Eric holds a unique place in our history.
"He was everything we now imagine a robot to be - a talking, moving mechanical person."

Stills from a night vision camera set up to track wildcats clearly show the nocturnal mammal standing on its hind legs and eating bait.
The public have been warned not to approach the raccoon as it could bite.
Stan Whitaker, SNH Wildlife and Non-Native Species Manager,  said: "Raccoons could cause millions of pounds worth of damage per year to the Scottish economy if they became established here.
"They could also cause significant damage to our native wildlife by preying on birds, small animals and amphibians.
"Raccoons aren't dangerous, but they may give you a nasty bite if cornered. The raccoon that has been recorded is an adult and roughly the size of a domestic cat."
He added: "Ideally, we would like to trap this raccoon and rehome it in a zoo or wildlife park.
"If you come across the raccoon, do not approach it, but please report it immediately to Scotland's Environmental and Rural Services."
Raccoons are listed as one of the top 50 invasive, non-native species in Scotland. Kept as pets and in zoos, there have been several escapes in the last few years.
They are considered a nuisance in their native north America,  as they damage buildings and gardens and forage in rubbish bins. They also carry wildlife diseases such as rabies.
In 2013, a raccoon called Ronnie spent three months on the run after escaping from a Perthshire wildlife park.

===Input Doc/Src: Fed up with the way British Airways was handling the issue of his father's lost luggage, businessman Hasan Syed decided to complain about it.
But rather than just put out a normal tweet, he paid to have one promoted.
Using promoted tweets in this way could represent a new trend, experts believe.
The promoted tweet bought by Mr Syed reads: "Don't fly @BritishAirways. Their customer service is horrendous."
Promoted tweets are generally bought by advertisers who want to reach a wider audience. The paid-for tweet is given high prominence in the Twitter feed of the relevant company but otherwise acts as a normal message and can be retweeted by others.
Mr Syed purchased his paid-for tweet via Twitter's self-service ad platform for an undisclosed sum. He targeted New York and UK markets with the tweet.
The decision to highlight BA's customer service came following a trip his parents made from Chicago to Paris at the weekend, during which his father lost his luggage.
Six hours after the tweet went live, and was picked up by news website Mashable, it had been read by thousands of Twitter users, retweeted and commented on.
But it took another four hours for British Airways to pick up on it: "Sorry for the delay in responding, our twitter feed is open 09:00-17:00 GMT. Please DM [direct message] your baggage ref and we'll look into this."
The idea that the ad platform of large corporations can be hijacked by members of the public is an interesting trend, thinks Shashank Nigam, chief executive of aviation consultancy SimpliFlying.
"The implications are tremendous for the future of airline customer service, especially on social media," he said in his blog.
"These tools are easy to use and brand detractors have the same access to them as corporations. I'd guess that this cost less than a thousand dollars to buy and Mr Syed targeted it smartly," Mr Nigam told the BBC.

He was also a double winner in the Superbike class at Dundrod on his BMW.
The Yorkshireman finished second in this season's British Superstock 1000cc series.
Hutchinson is also set to continue to compete in the Supersport class, in which he has enjoyed substantial success with Keith Flint's Team Traction Control Yamaha outfit in recent years.
A hat-trick hero at this year's TT and a four-time winner at this year's Ulster Grand Prix, Hutchinson has set his sights on further improvement next year.
He finished second to Michael Dunlop in both the Superbike and Senior TTs in 2016,
"Having now worked together for a season, we know where we need to improve with the obvious goal, to go on now and challenge for the Superbike wins at all of the big three internationals," said Hutchinson.
"The BMW S1000RR still has so much potential in Superbike trim on the roads and with another season of British Superstock planned, the aim there will be to go one step better and win the championship next season."

===Input Doc/Src: The Scottish Gamekeepers' Association said the latest employment figures showed the sector was outperforming other areas of the economy.
North Highland College in Thurso reported that every one of this year's Higher National Certificate students has secured a job on a sporting estate.
Country sports are thought to be worth Â£240m a year to the Scottish economy.
The gamekeeping and wildlife management course was designed to provide students with training in conservation as well as traditional gamekeeping skills, including snaring and the use of firearms.
North Highland College gamekeeping lecturer Richard MacNicol said: "The modern gamekeeper has to have a rounded, balanced approach to land management.
"Our graduates are helping to support the rural economy and a diverse, well managed countryside."
Borders College and Scotland's Rural University College in Fife also said the skills obtained by their students were proving valuable to landowners.
The Scottish Gamekeepers' Association has welcomed the news.
SGA chairman Alex Hogg said: "This is a major success story and the three colleges deserve immense credit.
"We are creating youth jobs at a time when the economy is faltering and young people, especially in remote areas, have few other opportunities."
There is real frustration amongst landowners and the gamekeepers they employ about the profession's image.
Political and media attention often focuses on cases of wildlife crime, most notably the illegal persecution of birds of prey.
Gamekeepers believe they do not get the credit they deserve for the stewardship of our countryside, while landowners argue the economic benefit of country sports is often overlooked.
They are hoping the new generation of gamekeepers being trained by Scotland's colleges will help change that.
Angus McNicol, of Cawdor Estates near Nairn, told BBC Scotland: "It's a highly-trained profession these days. It's very different to how things were in the past."

===Input Doc/Src: The first minister will say Wales needs two Labour governments to ensure the economy works "for everyone".
The party says it will deliver tidal lagoons, rail electrification and the Wylfa Newydd Nuclear Plant.
It will also create a Development Bank of Wales, if in power in Cardiff and London.
The party says it will ensure the level of funding Wales currently receives from the European Union continues beyond Brexit.
Welsh Labour has so far been attempting to run a largely separate election campaign, fronted by First Minister Carwyn Jones rather than UK leader Jeremy Corbyn.
At a launch for the campaign in Cardiff two weeks ago, Mr Jones made no reference to Mr Corbyn, and three of the five pledges unveiled related to the work of the Labour-run Welsh Government in Cardiff Bay, rather than issues under Westminster control.
Speaking at the launch in the Delyn constituency in north Wales later today, Mr Jones will say: "Our manifesto is an ambitious, comprehensive plan of what Welsh Labour can do, together, working in the assembly and Westminster."
He will add: "Working in partnership, Welsh Labour will commit to protecting the funding that would have come to Wales through the EU.
"That money will be spent in Wales, and on Welsh priorities, and not stashed away in Whitehall as the Tories now threaten."
The first minister will say a Labour government at Westminster would ensure an "estimated Â£1.5bn extra" will come to Wales every year.
The general election manifesto says Welsh Labour will also work with a UK Labour government to abolish the Severn bridges tolls and hand over responsibility for policing from Whitehall to the Welsh Assembly.

===Input Doc/Src: The Death of Poor Joe, which dates back to March 1901, was discovered by British Film Institute (BFI) curator Bryony Dixon, in February.
Until now the earliest known Dickens film was Scrooge or Marley's Ghost, released in November 1901.
"It's wonderful to have discovered such a rare and unique film," Ms Dixon said.
"It looks beautiful and is in excellent condition. This really is the icing on the cake of our current celebration of Dickens on Screen."
The Death of Poor Joe will be screened as part of the Dickens bicentennial celebrations on 9 March and 23 March at London's BFI Southbank.
The film organisation said it is also planning to release the footage on a DVD at a later date.
Accidental find
Ms Dixon stumbled across the find as she carried out research on early films of China.
A catalogue entry referred to The Death of Poor Joe, which she recognised as a reference to the character Jo in Bleak House.
After checking on the BFI's archive database, she found the film was listed as part of a collection under an alternative title of Man Meets Ragged Boy, which had been wrongly dated 1902.
The film, which is just one minute long, depicts Joe dying in the freezing snow against a churchyard wall.
As he falls to the ground a local watchman tries to help him and cradles him as he dies.
The footage, which was directed by film pioneer George Albert Smith, was handed to the BFI in 1954, by a collector in Brighton who had known Smith.
The BFI said it believes the director's wife, Laura Bayley, played Joe and the character of the watchman was played by Tom Green. The footage is believed to have been shot in Brighton.
The BFI said the storyline has similarities with Hans Christian Andersen's The Little Match Girl, which features a child dying in the snow and the tragic death of 'Poor Joe', the crossing sweeper in Dickens' Bleak House.
---Sum/Tgt: The oldest surviving film featuring a Charles Dickens character has been discovered, in the year of the 200th anniversary of the author's birth.

===Input Doc/Src: Teams are set to be composed of big-name players and sevens specialists.
New Zealand's Sonny Bill Williams is already playing full-time sevens but British clubs seem unlikely to release players until shortly before the Games.
"It is a very condensed programme and that puts us up against it," said Amor.
"The door is open for players from the 15-a-side game to put their hand up but the guys playing on the Sevens World Series, tournament in and tournament out, are in the driving seat."
In addition to 2015 Rugby World Cup-winner Williams, global names such as South Africa's Bryan Habana and Australia's Quade Cooper are keen on Olympic spots, while Wales wing George North and England back Danny Cipriani are among the home nations stars to have expressed an interest.
However, many of the players on show in Rio are likely to be sevens specialists who only play the abbreviated form of the game and have competed in the Sevens World Series for some time already,
England, Wales and Scotland compete separately on the Sevens World Series, but will come together to form a team for the Olympics.
And Amor hopes to hear before the end of the year if an application to field a Great Britain team at the second-tier Grand Prix Sevens series in summer 2016 will be approved.
The Grand Prix series consisted of three events last year and the 2016 finale will take place at Exeter's Sandy Park on 9-10 July - a month before the Olympic sevens tournament takes place.
While World Rugby's regulations state that players must be free to play in the Olympics themselves, clubs are under no such obligations to release their stars for the Sevens World Series, which begins on Friday in Dubai.
English side Wasps said in August that they would only allow players such as winger Christian Wade to join up with Great Britain two weeks before the start of the Olympics, in line with Premiership Rugby policy.

===Input Doc/Src: Jamie Frater, 43, was jailed for life in 1993 for the murder of teacher Geoffrey du Rose in Bournemouth.
He went on the run after failing to return to prison in 2012, but later gave himself up. He also absconded from open prison in 2001.
Members of the public are being advised not to approach Frater, who "could present a risk to the public".
Det Supt Jez Noyce, of Dorset Police, said: "There may be various reasons why he has not complied with his release from prison licence conditions and I appeal to him directly to make contact with police at the earliest opportunity.
"I'd like to assure members of the public that officers are making every effort to find this man as soon as possible".
Frater was convicted stabbing Mr du Rose when the teacher chased him from the garden of his home following a robbery at a nearby shop.
He is described as white, of medium build, 5ft 8ins tall, with short, receding, brown hair.

MSPs and the police watchdog are looking into transparency at the SPA.
Current board members defended Mr Flanagan, saying there was a "changing atmosphere".
The public audit committee has held a series of sessions on transparency at the authority, with one MSP, Alex Neil, decrying an apparent "secret society" within the board. He previously told Mr Flanagan that "it's not the Kremlin you're running".
In the latest session, witnesses included Derek Penman, HM chief inspector of constabulary in Scotland, Ms Ali, and a group of current board members.
Ms Ali left the board amid a row with Mr Flanagan over whether meetings should be held behind closed doors.
She said Mr Flanagan had told her that expressing disagreement publicly was a resignation matter, and told MSPs that her "removal from the board was straightforward punishment for speaking out".
She said it had been a "really horrendous experience", and said she did not believe it would have happened to her if she was a man.
Asked by Labour MSP Monica Lennon if she felt Mr Flanagan was fit to continue as chairman of the SPA board, she replied: "He's not fit to continue on any public board."
However, board members defended Mr Flanagan and the authority, with Iain Whyte characterising it as "an improving board and an improving organisation".
And George Graham said he didn't recognise the characterisation of the board presented, saying "we are listening and we are ready to adapt our approach".
He said there was a "changing atmosphere" at the SPA since Mr Flanagan took over, saying the board was "much more engaged" with "a clearer sense of purpose".
And he defended having meetings behind closed doors, saying there needed to be "clear space to discuss difficult and complex issues".

US President Barack Obama has called the presidents of Egypt and Libya to urge cooperation over security for diplomatic staff.
There have been further clashes outside the US embassy in Cairo overnight.
Thousands of people gathered outside the building in the Egyptian capital, chanting and starting fires.
Police and troops fired tear gas to break up the crowds, some of whom were seen carrying petrol bombs.
On Wednesday, demonstrators in Cairo angry at the film - Innocence of Muslims - had breached the walls of the US embassy and torn down the flag.
President Barack Obama has vowed to bring those behind the attack to justice, but said the US would not "break bonds" with the new Libyan government.
The White House says Mr Obama spoke to Libyan President Mohamed Magarief on Wednesday evening and agreed the two countries should work together to identify the attackers.
In a further call to Egypt, President Mohammed Morsi promised to ensure the safety of American staff in the country, the White House said.
Security has been tightened at US embassies across the world.
A marine anti-terrorism team is being deployed to Libya to bolster security there, a US defence source told reporters in Washington.

===Input Doc/Src: The Taliban have come close to the city in recent fighting, leaving it cut off and displacing tens of thousands.
A BBC correspondent who has flown into Kunduz has heard gunfire and artillery exchanges not far from its centre.
Afghan officials say foreign jihadists trained by the Islamic State (IS) group are fighting alongside the Taliban.
Provincial governor Mohammed Omer Safi told the BBC that the bodies of 18 foreign fighters, including three Chechen women, had been found.
Security forces and Taliban have been involved in a stand-off for about a week after the insurgents launched an offensive on Kunduz at the end of April.
The insurgents are currently said to be massed in the Gul Tepa district on the southern outskirts of the city.
This is the first positive confirmation by a senior government official that Islamic State is operating alongside the Taliban in Afghanistan.
Until now, particularly in the south of the country, IS fighters have often clashed with the Taliban. But the governor said that the battle for the north is different, and here IS fighters are "supporting the Taliban, training the Taliban, trying to build the capacity of the Taliban for a bigger fight".
And, he said, they were more violent because they wanted to die in battle as martyrs.
As well as from Afghanistan's immediate northern neighbours, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan, the dead came from Chechnya and Turkey. They were wearing black headbands marked with the same Islamic verses used by IS in Syria and Iraq.
Battle heralds militant tie-up
Correspondents say the advance is the most serious threat to a provincial capital in years.
Afghan army and police are involved in the fighting but there is no substantial help from foreign troops.
The BBC's David Loyn in Kunduz says Afghan forces are thinly spread in this region, and as well as this determined assault on Kunduz the Taliban and their allies have also attacked remote outposts in the mountains of Badakhshan further east.

Labour and Plaid had a "little Britain mentality" when a "globally facing Britain" was needed, Mr Davies wrote.
He made the comments in an article for The Times newspaper's website.
On Thursday, Welsh Government economic advisor Kevin Gardiner said some people were "perhaps unduly pessimistic" after the vote to leave the EU.
Within hours of the Brexit result being announced on June 24, Mr Jones said he feared it would cost Wales jobs.
In his article, to be published on Friday, Mr Davies said the first minister had been "particularly vociferous in his doom-laden economic forecasting, and in denigrating those who chose to leave".
"He has closed the doors on cross-party negotiation and now, having lost his nerve, seems unable to negotiate a deal for Wales, resorting instead to finger-wagging and pronouncements of 'I told you so'," Mr Davies wrote.
Plaid Cymru's call for independence "betrays how out of kilter they are with the needs of Welsh communities", he added.
"The prophets of doom and the independence mongers alike are wrong to take such a warped view of referendum result."
Mr Davies urged his political opponents to "lift their eyes to the sky and consider the limitless potential that now lies ahead of us and to embrace the outcome".
He added: "Instead they seem intent on clinging to a little Britain mentality. A globally facing Britain is what is now needed."

===Input Doc/Src: The up and down motion can fracture the ice, potentially aiding its break-up and melting, the researchers told Nature magazine.
They say storm swells may have a much bigger influence on the extent of polar sea ice than previously recognised.
The New Zealand-led team ran its experiments off Antarctica.
They placed sensors at various distances from the edge of the pack ice, and then recorded what happened when bad weather whipped up the ocean surface.
For smaller waves, less than 3m in height, the bobbing induced in the floes quickly decayed. But for waves over 3m, the disturbance sent propagating through the pack ice was sustained for up to 350km.
"At the ice edge, it's quite noisy," explained study lead author Alison Kohout, from New Zealand's National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research in Christchurch.
"You have lots of waves coming from all directions with a full spectrum of frequencies. But as the waves move into the ice, this all gets cleaned up to produce one beautiful, smooth wave of constant frequency," she told BBC News.
"The ice floes bend with the waves, and over time you can imagine that this creates fatigue and eventually the ice will fracture. Interestingly, the fractures tend to be perpendicular to the direction of the waves, and to be of even widths."
Computer modellers have been trying to simulate the recent trends in polar sea ice - without a great deal of success.
They have failed to capture both the very rapid decline in summer ice cover in the Arctic and the small, but nonetheless significant, growth in winter ice in the Antarctic.
Dr Kohout and colleagues say their experiments offer some clues - certainly in the south.
When they compared observed Antarctic marine-ice edge positions from 1997 to 2009 with likely wave heights generated by the weather during that period, they found a strong link.
For example, where storminess was increased, in regions like the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Sea, ice extent was curtailed.

===Input Doc/Src: Activists are unlikely to be throwing themselves off the pier in despair. That's not really the Lib Dem way. The party has always thrived in adversity. The conference hashtag is #LibDemfightback.
But it will be a bittersweet experience for some party members.
"This is bound to be an emotional conference for us," writes Caron Lindsay, editor of LibDem Voice.
The party's "brutal" defeat in May is still raw, she adds. "Being with our friends, mulling it all over with laughter, the odd tear and a whole load of gallows humour will undoubtedly help with that."
Here is a full rundown of the main speeches and debates.
The party is talking up the fact that it has gained 20,000 members since May's general election - and about 2,500 of them are going to be in Bournemouth. This is a record, according to party sources, surpassing the number of party members at the 2010 post-election gathering.
"It's going to be a busy, buzzy conference," says Lib Dem activist Mark Pack.
But it will still be a very different kind of Lib Dem conference to those we saw during the coalition years.
There will be no government ministers speaking from the main stage for one thing.
It is likely to feel more sparsely populated too. The corporate lobbyists who flooded into Lib Dem conferences during the coalition years have all but deserted the party. This means the bars and restaurants will be quieter and there will be far fewer fringe meetings. Far fewer journalists too.
The party's new leader Tim Farron has long been a darling of grassroots Lib Dem activists but the general public have little idea who he is.
He will be under pressure to do something about that this week - and also to stake out exactly where the party stands in the rapidly changing landscape of British politics.
He has described the election of Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader as a "staggering" opportunity for the Lib Dems to occupy the "centre ground" and attract back moderate Labour voters and members appalled by their new leader's hard

===Input Doc/Src: Media playback is not supported on this device
Even fewer could have imagined just how the game would ebb and flow, and ultimately provide Aberdeen with their first chance in 17 years to win a cup they treated as their own in the eighties.
In 1990, as Alex McLeish lifted the trophy just as Willie Miller had done four times in the preceding decade, it would have seemed inconceivable they would not do so again.
But those are the bare facts. And four consecutive losing semi-finals ensured no-one took victory today for granted.
And yet Aberdeen began the match with such a sense of authority and superiority that all doubt seemed to have been banished inside the opening 25 minutes.
Their desire to press Hibernian paid off in the opening seconds - a swifter reward than Derek McInnes could have possibly dreamed of.
But it was a tactic they continued to employ to great effect, snapping into tackles and denying the Hibernian backline and midfield any time or space to develop their game-plan.
The ploy looked a masterstroke from McInnes, but then Neil Lennon changed the game with one of his own.
The introduction of Grant Holt and a change of shape brought Hibs back from the dead - all of a sudden Hibs were able to play the ball forward and not find it coming instantly back on top of them.
Again his goal was a quicker pay-off than Lennon could have hoped for, but his overall impact - in particular his pass for Dylan McGeouch's equaliser - was phenomenal.
That equaliser came moments after another tactical switch - this time by Derek McInnes - whose decision to move to a back three appeared to play into Hibernian's hands.
The Hibs comeback was a significant test of Aberdeen's resolve. Having been so comfortable for 30 minutes, they were rattled by Holt's goal and at 2-2 the clever money was on the resurgent men from Leith.
But Aberdeen's determination to avoid a fifth successive Scottish Cup semi-final defeat kicked in and they clawed their way back into the game.

The council said budget cuts had forced it to give up the attractions.
Only one organisation has so far expressed interest.
Beaumaris courthouse and gaol, and Melin Llynnon and its ancient roundhouses, near Llanddeusant, are currently run by the council's museums and culture service.
Anglesey's head of learning, Delyth Molyneux, said: "Given the significant financial pressures faced and the fact that these sites don't form part of a statutory service, there's a real possibility that they will have to be mothballed or closed altogether if no one else can be found to run them."
Politicians had expressed concerns the courthouse and gaol could be sold to developers.
Beaumaris town councillor Jason Zalot said a sub-committee had been set up to look into running the Beaumaris gaol and courthouse.
"It's a massive undertaking for us. But bear in mind the town council have already taken over the management of the toilets.
"We have proven that we can work hand in the hand with the council."
Llynnon is currently closed and both Beaumaris courthouse and goal are open on weekends and during upcoming half term holiday.
Council leader Ieuan Williams said the council would do its best to support "interested parties" in order to ensure a smooth handover "as the success of these attractions is very important to us".

Boothroyd, 45, took charge for the U21 side's final two Euro 2017 qualifiers and secured qualification for this summer's finals in Poland.
"I've been at the FA three years; this is the logical next step," he said.
"I believe I am here on merit because I've worked in all four divisions and I've got an understanding of speaking to a League Two manager or a Premier League manager and the problems they have."
Boothroyd was in charge of Watford for three seasons from 2005, initially saving the club from relegation to the third tier before leading them to the top flight in 2006.
The Vicarage Road side finished bottom of the Premier League the following season, then failed to make an immediate return, losing in the play-off semi-finals.
Boothroyd left the following season and had a nine-month spell at Colchester and an 11-month stint at Coventry before taking charge at Northampton in 2011.
The side were bottom of League Two at the time and Boothroyd guided them to safety, and the play-offs the next season, before being sacked in 2013 with the club once again last in the fourth tier.
"You can get stuck in a job and I was very much on a hamster's wheel in my previous jobs," he told BBC Radio 5 live.

The 46-year-old suffered chronic kidney disease since birth and was on the verge of needing dialysis treatment.
Mr Clewes and Ms Crowther, 45, are now planning "a curry and a few beers" to celebrate the successful procedure, which was carried out in January.
"I've just got so much more energy now," Mr Clewes, a radio DJ from Crewe, Cheshire, said.
"There was a time when I could sleep 23-hour days, but now I struggle to get myself off to bed.
"It's hard to describe how it feels. Every now and then you remember how lucky you are to have your mate's kidney."
Mr Clewes said the pair would like to get involved in charity work to support others in need of transplants - and may even take on an extreme challenge.
"There are a few organisations who do skydives and things like that, and I've never done something like that before," he said.
"I think it's something I'd like to look at once I'm fully recovered."
Although his strength has returned, Mr Clewes will continue to need regular check-ups and medication to prevent his body rejecting the organ.
But he added: "I'm feeling great. I'm exercising. It's really a life-changing step and I don't want to let Helen down."
Ms Crowther, a charity worker from Runcorn, met her friend at a fundraising event in 2006 and later became "best woman" at his wedding.
She said: "I think Andy's a bit worried he might now take on some of my characteristics.
"I think his wife might like that as he might start tidying up around the house a bit more.
"We met up about four weeks after the operation and just fell back into normal every day chatting really.

"If you're a score down in a Test with 15 minutes to go and need to inject something different, a player like him might work for you," Smith said.
"Someone a bit more dynamic, with a huge work-rate, hugely athletic and fast, and could probably play in most positions in the backs and make a reasonable fist of it.
"He doesn't fit the mould of a standard back-row. He's not physically massive, but he punches above his weight.
"Every time he gets the ball, he does something interesting and he's very good over the ball.

"Defence is obviously going to be important, but I think we're going to have focus on scoring tries, which I think would probably work in Hamish's favour."
Former prop Smith, 45, toured with the storied Lions of 1997, starting all three Tests as the visitors overcame then world champions South Africa.
He repeated that feat four years later, cementing his status as the first-choice loose-head when Graham Henry's Lions were beaten 2-1 by Australia.

===Input Doc/Src: The unusual move by the agency came after White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer cited claims first made on US TV channel Fox News earlier this week.
GCHQ responded by saying the allegations were "nonsense, utterly ridiculous and should be ignored".
Mr Trump has claimed that Trump Tower in New York was under surveillance.
The GCHQ claims were initially made by former judge Andrew Napolitano.
Mr Spicer quoted Mr Napolitano as saying: "Three intelligence sources have informed Fox News that President Obama went outside the chain of command.
"He didn't use the NSA, he didn't use the CIA, he didn't use the FBI and he didn't use the Department of Justice, he used GCHQ."
A GCHQ spokesman said: "Recent allegations made by media commentator Judge Andrew Napolitano about GCHQ being asked to conduct 'wiretapping' against the then president-elect are nonsense.
"They are utterly ridiculous and should be ignored."
It is unusual for GCHQ to comment directly on a report about its intelligence work, normally preferring to stick to the policy of neither confirming nor denying any activity.
But the allegations are so sensitive that the agency clearly felt they could not let them go unchallenged.
Donald Trump's claim that the Obama administration had ordered surveillance on him has generated enormous attention but with so far little evidence to back it up.
And British intelligence is clearly determined to avoid being drawn into what is an increasingly toxic row in Washington.
A Senate committee has concluded that there are "no indications" Trump Tower was under surveillance by the US government before or after the election.
The statement from Senate Intelligence Committee chairman Richard Burr dismissed Mr Trump's claim his phones were tapped.
Mr Trump had accused his predecessor Barack Obama of wiretapping Trump Tower during the presidential race.
Mr Spicer said Mr Trump maintained his claims.

===Input Doc/Src: Five windows, including door panels, were smashed at Strawletterdallon Orange hall, near Newtownstewart in an attack discovered on Wednesday night.
Police described it as a sectarian hate crime.
The Orange Order said more windows were smashed at about 19:00 GMT on Thursday. The same hall was damaged five years ago in an arson attack.
The damage to the hall discovered on Wednesday is thought to have been caused during the previous night.
Inspector David McIlwaine said that the damage was caused to the rear of the building.
An Orange Order spokesman described those responsible as "mindless thugs intent on causing community division."
He said: "This was an act of wanton vandalism with the clear intention to cause damage and destruction to Orange property.
"However, the culprits are actually harming the wider community and groups who use the hall as a social hub and meeting place."
The Orange Order said that last year nine halls were targeted.

===Input Doc/Src: The 25-year-old has agreed a three-year deal with the European champions from the start of the 2017-18 season.
The switch - announced last month - will end a six-year association with the Scarlets which has seen Williams score 26 tries in 102 appearances.
"It was an opportunity I couldn't turn down," said Williams, who lines up for Wales against Scotland on Saturday.
"Hopefully, I'll go there and be part of a side that wins a couple more trophies.
"Saracens are European champions and were in another final two or three years ago. They've been English champions for a couple of years running."
The 40-time capped wing or full-back added that living closer to his girlfriend Sophie Harries, a London-based model, was another factor in his decision.
"It's a new chapter. I'm ready to try something different and looking forward to it," he added.
"I still have some games left for the Scarlets. We're looking to make the top four in the Pro12 and get into the play-offs and I want to help them achieve that.
"It would be brilliant if we could win a trophy this season."
Williams has not given up on adding the 2017 Six Nations title to his trophy cabinet.
The 21-16 defeat by England leaves Wales third in the table on five points, but Williams believes a win against Scotland - also on five points - could rekindle their challenge.
After Scotland, Wales play Ireland at home before rounding off their tournament with a trip to France.
"We have three tough games to play," said Williams, who has scored against Italy and England.

"We have to get our performances right and make sure we win our next three games. There's still a chance we could win the championship."
Williams' versatility in the back three make him a potential candidate to tour with the British and Irish Lions in the eyes of some pundits.

===Input Doc/Src: Two communities are claiming compensation and want Shell to clean up their land.
Shell said it is at an "early stage" in reviewing the claims and that the case should be heard in Nigeria.
The Ogale community of about 40,000 people in Rivers State, on the coast of Nigeria, who are mainly farmers or fishermen, are some of the claimants.
Their case is being handled by law firm Leigh Day.
Spills since 1989 have meant they don't have clean drinking water, farmland or rivers, their claim says.
It points to a November 2015 report by Amnesty International which says four spill sites Shell says it planned to clean up are still contaminated.
The first court hearing at the Technology and Construction Court, held on Wednesday, found that the claimants can can lodge a case against Shell's Nigerian business, known as Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (SPDC).  Shell declined to comment on the ruling.
Amnesty's findings followed a 2011 report by United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) which found water contaminated with oil by-products including benzene, thought to be a carcinogen. It suggested a clean up, but said a "sustainable recovery" of the area could take up to 30 years.
Shell says it has agreed a clean-up plan.
"In mid-2015 SPDC JV, along with the government, UNEP and representatives of the Ogoni community, agreed to an 18-month roadmap to fast-track the environmental clean-up and remediation of Ogoniland which includes a governance framework," it said in a statement.
The Bille community, who are mainly fishermen and are the other party to sue, claims Shell should be liable for "failing to protect their pipelines from damage caused by third parties", according to Leigh Day.
Pipelines in the area have been targets for thieves who steal crude oil and try to refine it locally. This has lead to more spills and damage though explosions.
"Both Bille and Ogale are areas heavily impacted by crude oil theft, pipeline sabotage and illegal refining which remain the ma

===Input Doc/Src: As Republican National Committee head Reince Priebus has pointed out, the rules are the rules, and they aren't a secret.
But Mr Trump is right that there are forces coalescing to stop him. And as of Sunday night - with the announcement that presidential candidates John Kasich and Ted Cruz are co-ordinating their efforts in upcoming state primaries - those forces aren't so silent anymore.
Neither Mr Cruz nor Mr Kasich can win the 1,237 delegates necessary to secure the Republican nomination for themselves. Their only hope is to deny Donald Trump that opportunity as well. And now, at last, their campaigns are publicly acknowledging that they need each other's help to do so.
As the two campaigns explained in dual press releases, Mr Cruz will focus on Indiana on 3 May, while Mr Kasich will be given free rein to challenge Mr Trump head-on in the Oregon and New Mexico contests over the following weeks.
This announcement comes just days before Mr Cruz and Mr Kasich are likely to receive a thorough drubbing in a handful of states in the mid-Atlantic, including delegate-rich Pennsylvania.
By Wednesday morning Mr Trump could have put considerably more distance between himself and his two opponents. So this accord may be an early effort to push the focus past the next round of voting and on to more friendly contests.
Indiana, one of the last big prizes of the primary season, is shaping up to be a pivotal battleground. A recent poll shows Mr Trump with a comfortable lead in a three-way race that narrows considerably if Mr Kasich is taken out of the equation.
Given the rules in Indiana - 30 delegates to the candidate who wins a statewide plurality and three delegates to the top finisher in each of the state's nine congressional districts - every bit of help Mr Cruz can get to edge past Mr Trump will be invaluable.
Independent groups backing the #NeverTrump efforts are pouring resources into the state in the hopes that a massive advertising blitz will dent the New York mogul's im

===Input Doc/Src: Glasgow Sheriff Court has previously heard that Harry Clarke was unconscious at the wheel when the lorry hit pedestrians on 22 December last year.
First Bus inspector John Stewart told the FAI that Mr Clarke had blacked out while unwell at a bus stop in 2010.
The inquiry is examining the bin lorry, its route and Mr Clarke's health.
Mr Stewart told the second day of the FAI, which is being overseen by Sheriff John Beckett QC, that he was an inspector and had been with First Bus Glasgow for 12 years.
He referred to notes he had taken on a Blackberry, detailing an incident involving Mr Clarke, while he was a bus driver, on 7 April 2010.
The notes of his daily report from that day state Mr Clarke "blacked out for a couple of minutes" while at a bus stop having "taken unwell".
Mr Stewart said he was alerted by a passenger on the number 54 bus that the driver had collapsed at the wheel.
The witness said Mr Clarke was still in the driver's seat of the bus when he arrived at the scene, but there were no passengers on board.
An ambulance was called and paramedics arrived to attend to Mr Clarke who was given the all clear and refused to go to hospital.
He was not allowed to drive the bus back, which was returned to the depot by Mr Stewart.
The witness said his involvement ended as soon as he left Mr Clarke and that he assumed the driver would have been sent to the company doctor.
Mr Stewart, under cross-examination from Dorothy Bain QC, agreed that "other people could be killed" due to a driver being "out of control" of the bus.
The witness said he did not know if a driver who had blacked out would be suspended, but he said he would not let them drive.
Going back over Mr Stewart's report, it was noted that Mr Clarke had driven the bus to the stop he was at after blacking out.
Mr Stewart said Mr Clarke "should have used his common sense" and not driven the bus, but said "you would have to ask him".
Ms Bain asked Mr Stewart if knew that Mr Clarke was suspended from driving and

===Input Doc/Src: An agreement has been reached to remove compulsory unit assessments from all National 5 and Higher courses.
The EIS said the move will "lighten the assessment burden for pupils and teachers".
The industrial action had threatened to disrupt work for the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA).
EIS general secretary Larry Flanagan said: "I can confirm that EIS Council has now agreed to suspend our programme of industrial action in relation to excessive SQA-related workload.
"The agreement that has now been reached at the CfE (Curriculum for Excellence) management board, based on a proposal submitted by the EIS, is a significant victory for teachers and pupils in our secondary schools.
"The changes that have been agreed, to permanently remove compulsory unit assessments from all National 5 and Higher courses, will ease the assessment burden on pupils and teachers and create time and space for deeper learning and teaching in our classrooms."
Deputy First Minister John Swinney said: "This is welcome news from the EIS and I am delighted that they have confirmed suspending a programme of industrial action in relation to teacher workload.
"Over the past few months, I have listened carefully to what teachers, parents, young people and others have had to say on workload, and have responded positively with a range of actions to help reduce workload pressures. As part of this, I have now announced the removal of mandatory unit assessments from National 5, Higher and Advanced Higher courses.
"This will significantly reduce the workload for our teachers, giving them more time to focus on what is most important - teaching our young people - while maintaining the core principles of Curriculum for Excellence."
Mr Swinney added: ""I am glad that the EIS have recognised these efforts and I hope that together we can move forward to ensure that teachers in Scotland have more time to teach, and contribute to closing the attainment gap."
---Sum/Tgt: The teaching union EIS has suspended a programme of industrial action over the workload faced by teachers in relation to examinations.

===Input Doc/Src: With the Women's Big Bash League over, Heather Knight reflects on another winter down under, pays tribute to one of her predecessors as England captain, is "put to shame by a 105-year-old", and looks ahead to a trip to Rwanda.
We've played some brilliant cricket but have been a little bit inconsistent through the year. Saying that, we've managed to punch above our weight for a second year in a row and make it to the semi-finals, despite many predictions to the contrary.
I've really enjoyed my time in the WBBL once again. It's definitely grown since last year with more publicity, more coverage and it's great to see some bigger crowds too.
The double-headers with the men's Big Bash League are, I think, definitely the way forward until the competition grows enough to stand by itself - although it would be great to see the time gap between the end of the women's matches and the start of the men's games reduced, in order to get more people to come to both.
The live online streaming of every WBBL match, outside of the TV broadcast fixtures, has been a very good addition, with highlights of every game available freely, and the social media presence has also been great.
Unfortunately I got roped into embarrassing myself with my woeful singing, featuring in the Hurricanes' rendition of Taylor Swift's "Shake It Off" on the WBBL Pitch Perfect show with Aussie comedian Bobby. Note: the costumes were to try to mask our dreadful voices!
I think there is a lot that can be learned from the WBBL to take into the ECB's second season of the Kia Super League this summer.
Having two expanding domestic competitions in Australia and England will only help the global development of the women's game, so hopefully the Super League will bounce off the back of the second WBBL, and of course the ICC Women's World Cup on home soil in June and July.

===Input Doc/Src: BitTorrent Sync uses peer-to-peer technology to send information between users' PCs.
It eliminates the need to upload data to a third party's computer servers, as is the case with services such as Dropbox, Google Drive and SkyDrive.
But one analyst said businesses were unlikely to be tempted by the idea.
Davies Murphy Group's Chris Green said companies would worry about their lack of control over the new process even though it did not rely on a third-party's data centre to update what might be sensitive files.
But he said it might appeal to some members of the public for private use.
BitTorrent is an eight-year old San Francisco-based company offering a range of free-to-use products designed to make it easy and quick to send large files over the internet.
They work by co-ordinating the process so that devices downloading material also share small pieces of already-accessed data with others in order to share the load.
Although the technology has become associated with media piracy due to its use by some media-sharing sites, BitTorrent itself is a legal company that makes money by licensing its technology and brands to business customers.
It began testing the new tool at the start of the year. The facility is categorised as alpha - signalling it is still being tested and may be unstable - but the firm announced on its blog that it was now ready to invite the public to try it out.
It suggested users might find it quicker and more private than the alternatives.
"Since Sync is based on P2P [peer-to-peer technology] and doesn't require a pit-stop in the cloud, you can transfer files at the maximum speed supported by your network," it said.
"Your information is never stored on a server in the cloud; your data is protected by encrypted keys. Your files belong to you, and stay on the devices of your choice."
To prevent unauthorised access to shared data, the software generates a private key for each synched folder on the original device.
This is made up of at least 32 charac

No year could pass without a major product launch and this year's most read was the announcement in September that Apple was entering the crowded wearable market with a smart watch of its own.
Every year could be described as the year of the hack but 2014 saw some pretty significant ones, not least the Heartbleed bug which put security experts into a tailspin in April.

January: 'Super-rare' Nintendo games hits eBay
Fans of old video games were queuing up to get their hands on a copy of Nintendo World Championships, one of only 116 copies made as part of a special event in 1990.
A first bid of $4,999 (Â£3,000) set the tone for the eBay auction.
Even though the cartridge was in poor condition, its rarity - designed for a competition and never put on general sale - meant it would be something of a holy grail for keen collectors, according to gaming experts.
The game eventually sold to a bidder for over $99,0000 - although the winning bidder later backed out.

The game theme continued into February when everyone was talking about the new gaming sensation - Flappy Bird. Seen as a natural successor to Angry Birds, it proved short-lived when its Vietnamese creator Dong Nguyen announced that he was removing the game from online stores.
Many questioned whether the real reason was because he may have faced legal action from Nintendo as the main characters resembled those in Super Mario Bros.

===Input Doc/Src: The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) said there were "major issues" in the way allergies were recorded and shared.
In its first guidelines on allergy, it is calling for known allergies to be recorded on all prescriptions.
The charity Allergy UK said a "lack of awareness" was putting lives at risk.
Official data recorded 18,079 incidents of drug allergies affecting patient safety in the NHS in England and Wales between 2005 and 2013.
Most involved medicines which were prescribed to a patient with a known allergy to that class of drugs.
Prof Mark Baker, the director of the centre for clinical practice at NICE, said: "If we know that giving someone a particular drug could cause them harm, or in the worst instances may even kill them, the utmost care must be taken to ensure they are not prescribed or administered that drug."
NICE said efforts were needed to "dispel confusion" over allergies after "major issues" were discovered as the guidelines were drawn up.
It called for improvements in the way doctors collect information on patients' allergies. It also wants a re-design of all prescriptions to include information on the classes of drugs to which a patient is known to be allergic.
Signs of allergy include fever, hives, wheezing, redness and swelling.
Dr Shuaib Nasser, a consultant allergist at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, stated: "The guideline stresses the care all healthcare professionals must take when documenting new drug allergies and the importance of sharing this information with patients and other healthcare professionals.
"People should be provided with structured written information on drugs to avoid and be advised to check with their pharmacist before taking over-the-counter medicines.
"In some cases, specialist investigations will be required to confirm or exclude drug allergy."

Areas affected include Bonnyrigg, Loanhead, Fairmilehead, Colinton, Sighthill, South Gyle, Oxgangs, Kirkliston and Bo'ness.
The work will resurface runway areas particularly the touchdown zones.
The airport said 16 flights would operate during the renovations, and the main runway would reopen before 06:00 each morning.
Gordon Dewar, chief executive of Edinburgh Airport, said: "As the airport continues to grow our runway is subjected to heavier loads and more frequent aircraft movements.
"These heavy forces can cause the runway surface to degrade over time.

The film is based on French author Jean-Daniel Baltassat's 2013 novel.
Depardieu was presented with a Russian passport by Vladimir Putin in 2013 after moving to avoid higher taxes in his native France.
Mr Depardieu's move to Russia came after he criticised French President Francois Hollande's plans to raise taxes to 75% for those earning more than 1m euros (Â£817,400).
The actor accused the government of punishing "success, creation and talent".
In 2011, he played the lead role in the film Rasputin, a Franco-Russian production about the life of eccentric monk.
He also recently announced a movie about WW2 French fighter aces who flew alongside Red Air Force pilots over the Eastern Front.
Josef Stalin, the supreme ruler of the Soviet Union for more than 25 years, helped the allies defeat Nazism.
But his regime of terror caused the death and suffering of tens of millions.

The funeral of Ms Stewart, an accounts student from Cumbernauld, was held at Our Lady and St Helen's Parish Church in her home town.
About 200 people attended the ceremony to pay their respects.
Outside the church floral tributes were laid, including the name "Laura" written out in red and white flowers opposite the word "sister" in purple flowers.
Tributes left with the flowers included a card saying "with all our love for always, mum and dad" and another to a "beautiful" girl who was a "loving friend and sister".
The order of service showed a photo of the student with the words "Courage grows strong at a wound" - the motto of the Stewart clan.
Mourners wept as the white coffin with purple handles was carried out of the church to the hymn Walk With Me Oh My Lord.
Father Gerald Sharkey led the procession out of the church through the snow. The body was then driven to Eastfield Cemetery in Cumbernauld for a private burial.
Ms Stewart and Ms Convy, of Lennoxtown, studied at Glasgow College of Commerce.
Following the crash, the two women were taken to Glasgow Royal Infirmary, where they died.

===Input Doc/Src: Revenue Scotland is responsible for the administration and collection of Land and Building Transaction Tax (LBTT) and Scottish Landfill Tax (SLfT).
It collected £425m through LBTT and £147m from SLfT in the year from 1 April 2015 to 31 March 2016.
The Scottish government had originally forecast revenues of £498m in 2015-16, which was later increased to £508m.
Almost all (98%) of the 115,000 tax returns were submitted through the new online Scottish Electronic Tax System, exceeding an initial target of 90%.
Revenue Scotland's operating costs for administering the collection of taxes was £4.67m - lower than the Scottish government's original £4.81m budget allocation for the organisation.
Revenue Scotland's chairman, Dr Keith Nicholson, said the agency's first year had been "hugely successful", with the online tax system having "exceeded expectations and received widespread praise".
He added: "These achievements are a clear signal to the Scottish taxpayer that Revenue Scotland is operating efficiently and effectively as Scotland's devolved tax authority."
Welcoming the figures, Finance Secretary Derek Mackay said: "The scale of the challenge of introducing the first Scottish taxes in more than 300 years should not be underestimated, and it's encouraging to see this has been done so effectively."
LBTT and SLfT  came into effect on 1 April 2015, replacing their UK equivalents (Stamp Duty Land Tax and UK Landfill Tax respectively) in Scotland.
The revenue collected is transferred to the Scottish Consolidated Fund to support the delivery of public services in Scotland.
Revenue Scotland will also collect a Scottish replacement for Air Passenger Duty when it is introduced, but will not administer the Scottish Rate of Income Tax, which will continue to be the responsibility of HMRC.
---Sum/Tgt: Scotland's new tax agency has collected £572m in its first year - well above the amount that had been expected.

Liberal senator Eric Abetz called for Mr Abbott to make a comeback saying he has "more to offer public life".
Abbott was unseated by current Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in September.
"I'm on the record as saying that I believe Tony Abbott has more to offer public life in Australia," Mr Abetz told the Australian Broadcasting Corp (ABC).
"I hope that he stays in the Parliament and I hope that there will be a place for him, a prominent place for him, in any future ministry should he decide to stay.
Another politician calling for Mr Abbott's return was Nationals Senator John Williams, who told the ABC the move would help "heal the wounds of the past".
Cities minister Jamie Briggs resigned yesterday after a female public servant lodged an official complaint about his behaviour in a Hong Kong bar in September.
Mr Briggs said that he had failed to live up to the high standards expected of a government minister.
Special Minister for State Mal Brough also stepped aside pending the result of a federal police investigation into alleged his role in the illegal procurement of a rival politician's private diary.

Mr Jones told S4C's Newyddion 9: "People say things and if they had their time again they would say things differently. But to react in this way... that is not a mature response."
"If Leighton had his time again I know he would say something different.
He said Mr Andrews had "offered to apologise, but no".
"Plaid Cymru said they would vote against this no matter what happens with any sort of apology," he said.
As well as a ban on e-cigarette use in some public places, the bill aimed to create a compulsory licensing system for tattooists, ban intimate piercing of children under 16 and require councils to produce a local toilets strategy.
Plaid originally planned a free vote and some of its AMs were expected to support the bill on Wednesday evening, although a greater number were in opposition.
But the party's last minute decision to vote against it as a group meant the assembly was tied 26-26 and the legislation failed.
But Dafydd Elis-Thomas told BBC News he was not informed about Plaid's decision. He had made arrangements to cancel his assembly vote.
"I did not imagine that by not being present I would have helped to lose a piece of important Welsh legislation," Lord Elis-Thomas said.
"I've experienced many low points in this fourth assembly in my relationship with the party, but this is the lowest."
He said he and party leader Leanne Wood, who was against the ban, agreed to not attend the vote - known as pairing - meaning their absences would cancel each other out from the tally.

===Input Doc/Src: Based on CT scans, the organs are fitted into a realistic synthetic "body" and connected to pumps which mimic human breathing and blood flow.
Nottingham Trent University, with the NHS and Ministry of Defence, used silicone gels to replicate the feel of human tissue.
Bespoke models could now be created to prepare for individual operations.
Richard Arm, of Nottingham Trent University's School of Art & Design, said he was asked to come up with a heart model for a surgeon who wanted to practice performing an implant.
He said: "When making more organs, the trickiest part was the flexibility.
"The heart has 17 different 'hardnesses' so 'does it feel right?' turns out to be a bit vague.
"Then we put them together and I knew we were getting it right when I started to feel sick."
The prototype - officially known as a thoracic trauma trainer - will be exhibited to trauma treatment experts.
After feedback, two models are due to be produced for the MoD by December 2017.
Colonel Peter Mahoney, emeritus professor at Defence Medical Services, said the requirement was for training equipment that was portable, robust and reusable, while "also achieving a realism" that had only previously been possible with dead bodies.
He added: "We wanted to start with the chest, because it is a common area connected with trauma, but if it could be created with realistically-moving lungs and blood vessels then any other body parts would be possible."
Future developments could include the brain, eyes, stomach, pancreas, liver and kidneys, the vascular system in a person's legs and bespoke models for patient-specific preoperative surgical planning.

===Input Doc/Src: The star joined forces with her cousin, Senator Charles Schumer, to unveil a set of proposals for more stringent background checks on gun buyers.
"The time is now for American people to rally for these changes," she said.
President Obama recently said the failure to pass gun safety laws was the greatest frustration of his presidency.
His comments came on 23 July, just hours before a gunman opened fire on a movie theatre in Lafayette, Louisiana, killing two women and injuring nine other patrons, before taking his own life.
John Houser, 59, legally purchased his semi-automatic 40-calibre handgun in Alabama in 2014, following a background check that failed to reveal he had a history of psychiatric problems and had been the subject of domestic violence complaints.
Schumer, whose film was playing at the cinema, said the incident sickened her.
"I've thought about these victims each day since the tragedy," she said at a news conference at the senator's office in New York.
"People say, 'Well, you're never going to be able to stop crazy people from doing crazy things,' but they're wrong. There is a way to stop them," she added.
Senator Schumer, a New York democrat, wants to improve background checks by creating financial incentives for states that submit information to a database the FBI uses to screen gun buyers.
His bill would also create penalties for states that fail to submit records to the database. He stressed that the proposals were about strengthening the background check system, not putting new restrictions on buyers.
He also urged Congress to provide full funding to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which faces a proposed 4.4% cut of $159m (Â£101m).
But with gun ownership a contentious issue in US politics, the senator acknowledged he would struggle to get his bill passed into law.

===Input Doc/Src: All three teaching unions are now taking some form of industrial action over their concerns about the new courses.
Problems highlighted include the level of bureaucracy and increased workload.
These are likely to be among the topics raised at a regular meeting involving unions, education chiefs and others.
The group brings together a full range of stakeholders including the Scottish government, the exams body the SQA, senior figures in education such as directors of education from local authorities, all three unions and the council umbrella body Cosla.
But finding a solution which fully addresses the concerns of unions and leads to an end to industrial action will be a challenge.
School qualifications have been through a three-year shake-up.
Standard Grades and Intermediates were scrapped, National 4 and 5 qualifications were introduced and Highers and Advanced Highers were revamped.
Although the shake-up is now complete - and this year's S4 students will be the fourth set of pupils to study for N4s and N5s - some teachers and unions have serious practical worries.
Their concerns are about how the new courses are working out in practice - not the qualifications themselves or the underlying aims of the changes.
One issue concerns ongoing assessments - unit assessments - in the National 5 and Higher courses.
Members of the largest union - the EIS - are now taking part in a partial work-to-rule over their concerns. Teachers are not taking part in work linked to developing the new qualifications unless they are contractually obliged to.
However the work-to-rule should have no direct impact on learners and the union stresses it does not cover other additional activities teachers do such as sports clubs and school trips.
The EIS has argued that there is unnecessary duplication between the assessments and the exams.
The union said it wanted to see an acceptable timetable for a significant reduction in unit assessments and the workload associated with them.

===Input Doc/Src: The lender was the biggest faller on Germany's main stock market before paring back the losses.
Talks between chief executive John Cryan and the US Department of Justice ended without agreement at the weekend, according to reports.
The bank has been under intense pressure over the size of the fine.
Mr Cryan was in the US for the International Monetary Fund and World Bank's autumn meetings.
Some investors had hoped that while he was there, he might negotiate down a settlement for the bank's mis-selling of mortgage-backed securities.
Others, though, said it was always unlikely the bank could strike a deal with the US authorities so quickly.
Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: "Deutsche Bank hasn't as yet been able to come to any agreement with the US Justice Department as it looks to overcome the hurdle of the prospect of a rather large fine.
"Talks are continuing while the bank looks at potentially spinning off a stake in its asset management division in order to free up some extra capital."
Terry Torrison, managing director at McLaren Securities, said the bank was "never going to sort out the US issues that quickly".
Deutsche Bank's shares touched 33-year lows at the end of September, before recovering slightly in recent days, over fears its finances are not strong enough to handle a large US fine.
The bank declined to comment on reports Mr Cryan had failed to reach a deal. The share price recovered to close slightly up by the end of trading.

===Input Doc/Src: The Muslim Personal Law Board told the Supreme Court that men were "better at controlling emotions and unlikely to take a hasty decision".
The board's explanation came after Muslim women complained about gender discrimination in divorce cases.
Activists said the comments were "patriarchal, inhuman and unjust".
The Supreme Court is hearing several petitions challenging what is known as the "instant triple talaq" where a Muslim man can divorce his wife in a matter of minutes by just uttering the word talaq (divorce) three times.
"Their [the All India Muslim Personal Law Board or AIMPLB] stand that 'men have greater reasoning power compared to women' smacks of a medieval mindset and prejudice against women," the Mumbai-based Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan (BMMA - Indian Muslim Women's Movement) and the All India Democratic Women's Association said in a joint statement.
"Their justification of polygamy and triple talaq contravenes the constitution and indeed the principles of gender justice in Islam. Triple talaq is unilateral and arbitrary. Nowhere in the Islamic world is triple talaq legal. We oppose it and demand a ban on it forthwith," the statement added.
The activists said the board should apologise to all women and ensure that their statements in the future were not derogatory to women.
Muslims are India's largest minority community with a population of 155 million and their marriages and divorces are governed by the Muslim personal law, ostensibly based on the sharia.
Women's groups and campaigners say the controversial practice of triple talaq is un-Koranic and must be declared unconstitutional.
Most Islamic countries, including Pakistan and Bangladesh, have banned triple talaq, but it thrives in India, they say.
Islamic scholars too say the Koran clearly spells out how to issue a divorce - it has to be spread over three months which allows a couple time for reflection and reconciliation.

===Input Doc/Src: Jose Salvador Alvarenga thanked the president of the Marshall Islands, where he was found late last month, before boarding a flight to Hawaii.
He says he left Mexico for a trip in a fibre-glass boat in December 2012 with a friend who died on board.
He apparently survived the 8,000 km (5,000-mile) ordeal by catching fish, birds and turtles with his bare hands.
For fluids, he claimed to have drunk urine, rainwater and the blood of birds.
He was rescued on 30 January by people living on the island of Ebon Atoll.
"Thank you for everything the people of the Marshall Islands have done for me during my stay," Mr Alvarenga, 37, said through an interpreter before leaving for Hawaii. He will make his way from there to El Salvador to be reunited with his relatives.
President Christopher Loeak presented him with a woven garland, the AFP news agency reports.
The fisherman had been due to leave last Friday, but doctors said he needed more rest.
The family of his younger friend say they want to speak to Mr Alvarenga to find out more about how their son died, and what happened to his body.
Known as Ezequiel, he is believed to have starved after being unable to eat raw birds and fish.
Three Mexican fishermen were rescued off the Marshall Islands in August 2006 after what they said was about nine months drifting across the Pacific Ocean.
They survived on rain water, seabirds and fish.
Castaways from Kiribati, to the south, frequently find land in the Marshall Islands after ordeals of weeks or months at sea in small boats.

===Input Doc/Src: United are on the verge of completing a transfer for the 23-year-old that could cost them in excess of £100m.
"If you are making money and have to pay big money for the best players, why not do it?" Robson told BBC Radio 5 live's Sportsweek programme.
Manager Jose Mourinho wants the deal to be completed before 14 August.
No deal has been announced for Pogba, who has been on holiday in the United States since losing the Euro 2016 final with France against Portugal last month.
Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri has said he expects the midfielder to be at training on Monday, although reports in Italy say Pogba has flown to the UK for a medical.
Manchester United have not responded to these reports.
Pogba played at United for three years before rejecting a new contract and joining Juventus for a £1.5m compensation fee in 2012.
He won the Serie A title in four successive seasons in Italy and has established himself as one of the most highly rated players in the world.
"Sir Alex Ferguson allowed me to watch training as Pogba joined the first team squad [as a teenager]," said Robson.
"I was very impressed with him. He was a good build, with a good temperament.
"He is the type of player we need.
"He is similar to Yaya Toure in the sense he is very good going forward and can score spectacular goals.
"I am not sure he is a great defender but he does an adequate job."

===Input Doc/Src: The lender said that property prices grew by 3.6% in the three months to the end of July compared with the previous quarter.
The monthly increase was 1.4% compared with June, making the average home worth Â£186,332.
The figures are at odds with other surveys which suggest a slowdown.
This is the first time since September 2007 that the annual change has gone above 10%, according to the Halifax. It accelerated from an 8.8% rise in June.
"While supply remains low, housing demand continues to be supported by a continuing economic recovery, growth in employment, improving consumer confidence and low mortgage rates," said Stephen Noakes, mortgages director at the Halifax.
The numbers, based on its own mortgage lending, counter the view put forward by rival lender Nationwide, which said prices had started to moderate.
The Nationwide's estimate of the annual house price rise slowed from 11.8% in June to 10.6% in July.
The year-on-year comparison is calculated slightly differently by the two lenders. The Halifax compares the previous three months with the same three months a year earlier to give a smoother comparison, rather than a direct comparison of the equivalent months as calculated by the Nationwide.
The Land Registry has also suggested that seven out of 10 regions of England and Wales showed a monthly fall in prices, although these short-term price changes are often volatile.
Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist for IHS Global Insight, said: "On balance, we take the view that house prices will keep on clearly rising over the coming months but there will be some moderation from the recent peak levels."
Halifax is part of Lloyds Banking Group, which recently announced that it was moving to reduce its share of mortgages under the government's Help to Buy scheme.
Borrowers are now able to raise a maximum of Â£150,000 through Help to Buy, down from Â£500,000.

===Input Doc/Src: "We will absolutely want him to have the death penalty," Nikki Haley told NBC television.
Suspect Dylann Roof, 21, is due to make his first court appearance on Friday.
He was arrested on Thursday more than 200 miles away in North Carolina and flown back to South Carolina.
Police are treating the killings at the Emanuel AME Church on Wednesday evening as a hate crime.
Prayer vigils have been held in churches in Charleston and across the US for the six women and three men who died.
At the vigil for victim Sharonda Singleton, her teenage children told the BBC they had forgiven her killer and wanted to focus on moving on in a positive way.
"We already forgive him for what he's done," said her son, Chris.
"And there's nothing but love from our side of the family. Love is stronger than hate."
Churches in Charleston were full to overflowing on Thursday evening as prayer services were held. Some services were held outdoors.
Hundreds gathered outside the Emanuel AME Church to pay tribute.
Governor Haley told NBC's Today show that South Carolina had been "hurt" by the deaths of nine innocent people.
She said she wanted the suspect tried on state charges in South Carolina rather than federal charges.
Mr Roof is due to appear in court via video link for a bail hearing on Friday. He is being held at a detention centre in the Charleston area, the county sheriff's office said.
He was detained on Thursday after police acting on a tip-off stopped his car in Shelby, North Carolina.
Police had earlier released CCTV images of the suspect and the dark saloon car he had driven away in.
Mr Roof's social media presence suggests he was interested in white supremacy.
His Facebook profile page shows a picture of him wearing a jacket with flag-patches from apartheid-era South Africa and Rhodesia - the name of Zimbabwe during the era of white minority rule. He also had a Confederate flag plate on his car.

===Input Doc/Src: The bucardo became extinct in 2000, but cells from the last animal were frozen in liquid nitrogen.
In 2003, a cloned calf was brought to term but died a few minutes after birth.
Now, the scientists will test the viability of the female bucardo's 14-year-old preserved cells.
The bucardo, or Pyrenean ibex, calf born through cloning was an historic event: the first "de-extinction", in which a lost species or sub-species was resurrected.
The Aragon Hunting Federation signed an agreement with the Centre for Research and Food Technology of Aragon (CITA) in Zaragoza to begin preliminary work on the cells from the last animal, named Celia.
One of the scientists behind the cloning effort, Dr Alberto Fernandez-Arias, told BBC News: "At this moment, we are not initiating a 'bucardo recovery plan', we only want to know if Celia's cells are still alive after having been maintained frozen during 14 years in liquid nitrogen."
In addition to this in vitro work, they will also attempt to clone embryos and implant them in female goats.
"In this process, one or more live female bucardo clones could be obtained. If that is the case, the feasibility of a bucardo recovery plan will be discussed," Dr Fernandez-Arias, who is head of the Aragon Hunting, Fishing and Wetlands Service, explained.
The bucardo (Capra pyrenaica pyrenaica) was a sub-species of ibex, with distinct physical and genetic characteristics to other mountain goats inhabiting the Iberian Peninsula. It was perfectly adapted to life in its mountain habitat, and to survive the extreme cold and snow of winter in the Pyrenees.
However, its population had been declining for years for several reasons, including hunting. In April 1999, researchers captured the last animal, a female named Celia. They obtained skin biopsies and froze the tissue in liquid nitrogen at a temperature of -196C (-321F).
The following year, Celia was killed by a falling tree in the National Park of Ordesa in north-east Spain. But a team including Dr Fernan

===Input Doc/Src: The officers said they felt sorry for the migrants, who were found in a lorry in Belgium, and offered to give them a lift to the border.
But they strayed into France, where they were arrested and questioned.
The incident sparked a diplomatic spat, with France's interior minister summoning the Belgian ambassador.
Bernard Cazeneuve had a "frank and clear" meeting with the Belgian ambassador, according to French officials, and expressed his disquiet at what had happened.
France strongly condemned the officers' action which "does not conform to the normal work practices agreed between France and Belgium".
But there was surprise at the French reaction from Georges Aeck, the Ypres police commissioner, because of the two countries' usual close border co-operation.
"We didn't do it for money, this isn't human trafficking," he told Belgian broadcaster RTBF. "We only gave them a hand. We took them a little way in the direction they wanted to go,"
The bizarre chain of events began on Tuesday evening, when French police in an unmarked car stopped the Belgian police van carrying the 13 migrants, including three minors, on the French side of the border in Nieppe, north-west of Lille.
The migrants had been discovered earlier in the day and ordered to leave the country.
But when the officers spotted them walking on foot towards the border, they offered them a lift and accidentally strayed into France near Nieppe.
The two officers were handcuffed, despite identifying themselves, the Belgian police union said.
Vincent Gilles, the president of the Belgian police union, complained that the officers had been treated like "criminal suspects" and held for four hours without access to a lawyer.
Mr Aeck added: "It's the first time this has happened because we have a good relationship with our French colleagues. We sometimes organise the control system together on the border. We are a little surprised.

Earlier this week, President Zuma recalled Mr Gordhan from planned events in the UK and US.

"I have directed the new ministers and deputy ministers to work tirelessly with their colleagues to bring about radical socioeconomic transformation and to ensure that the promise of a better life for the poor and the working class becomes a reality," President Zuma's statement said.
Last October, Mr Gordhan was charged with fraud - but the charges were later dropped.
He has described the allegations as politically motivated.
Mr Gordhan has been seen as standing up to President Zuma in cabinet and has warned against corruption becoming rampant.

===Input Doc/Src: But the inquiry into the attack on the Pulse gay night club, in which 49 people were killed, is being treated as a terrorist investigation, he added.
The FBI's director said the gunman was radicalised through the internet.
Meanwhile Donald Trump said he would suspend immigration from certain areas of the world to the US.
The presumptive Republican presidential candidate also renewed his call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country.
The US authorities say gunman Omar Mateen pledged allegiance to IS shortly before the attack in Florida.
However, the extent of any links to IS remains unclear.
Speaking in Washington, Mr Obama said: "It does appear that at the last minute he [gunman Omar Mateen] announced allegiance to Isil [IS].
"But there is no evidence so far that he was in fact directed.
"This is certainly an example of the kind of home-grown extremism that all of us have been concerned about for a very long time."

Responding to the Orlando shootings, Mr Trump reiterated his proposal to ban foreign Muslims from entering the US.

===Input Doc/Src: The Canadian singer told BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs that the executive told him his music would not sell.
He told Buble he would only produce his music for $100,000 (Â£82,000) a track, just to get rid of him.
The singer has now sold more than 50 million albums around the world.
Buble started out as a swing crooner and also sings jazz and pop songs.
He told presenter Kirsty Young that David Foster, who has worked with Whitney Houston and Celine Dion, had told him: "You will never be signed to my label, I will never produce you.
"You are talented but I see no record sales for this genre of music.
"To dismiss me, [Foster] said, 'For $100,000 a track, I will produce on spec a record for you, and because I'm an executive of Warner Bros they'll get first right of refusal.
"And then he pushed me out the door thinking he would never see me again."
But the singer said the encounter made him determined to raise the money to work with Foster.
"What he didn't know was that I would go back to Vancouver and go bank to bank with a manager I had at the time and find an investor," Buble said.
"I flew back to Los Angeles and went to David's house, and he said 'What do you want?' And I said 'Mr Foster I have the money.'
"He couldn't believe I had come back. But he said, 'All right', and we started making the record."
Later, Buble explained, he asked Foster if he could speak to the president of Warner Bros and "plead" for the album to be released.
"I walked into the Warner Bros records' home in Burbank, and I don't think I'd ever been as terrified," Buble said.
"This executive named Tom Whalley came in the room and he said 'Why should we sign you? We have [Frank] Sinatra'."
"And I said 'With all due respect, Sinatra's dead, don't bury the music with him.' I said 'I'll work hard and help fill the void and we will keep this music alive together'.
"Three days later, I was on the treadmill and my grandfather was with me, and the doors flung open and my grandfather said 'Sunshine, yo

===Input Doc/Src: Pastor James McConnell, 78, denies two charges relating to a sermon he gave in a church last year.
A prosecution lawyer said his words were not "a slip of the tongue", while a defence lawyer said he should not be convicted.
Judgement was reserved, and the verdict will be given on 5 January.
Summing up the prosecution's case, a barrister said Pastor McConnell, of Shore Road, Newtownabbey,  was "not on trial for his beliefs", but for what he said and using words that were allegedly grossly offensive.
"He intended to use those words, it wasn't a slip of the tongue," he told Belfast Magistrates Court.
However, a defence barrister called on the court to find Pastor McConnell not guilty.
He said he was a man with an unblemished record who should be recognised for his good works in society, not convicted in court.
Earlier, Pastor McConnell told the court that he still believed in what he had preached, and did not go into church to "provoke anyone".
He said he only realised he may have offended anyone when he got a call from BBC Radio Ulster's Nolan Show.
"I was attacking the theology of Islam. I was not attacking any individual Muslim," he told the court.
"I didn't realise that good Muslim people would be hurt.
"I didn't go into the church to provoke anyone. I went into church to present the truth."
Asked why he refused an informal warning that would have prevented a criminal trial he said: "If I took it, that would be an insult to the one I love ... that was me gagged for the rest of my life."
DUP MP Sammy Wilson and Catholic priest Fr Patrick McCafferty appeared as character witnesses for Pastor McConnell.
Fr McCafferty said that in spite of their theological differences, the pastor and he shared a Christian love.
"He has no hatred," he said.
Pastor McConnell is charged with improper use of a public electronic communications network and causing a grossly offensive message to be sent by means of a public electronic communications network.

===Input Doc/Src: The firm is to license a new cancer treatment to Californian company Genentech.
The treatment is a class of drug molecules developed by Almac's discovery division.
Genentech will make an upfront payment of around £9m with further payments and possible royalties to follow.
Almac will be eligible to receive up to £225m in milestone payments plus royalties on commercial sales of any products developed by Genentech
The two companies will also run a two-year joint research programme funded by Genentech
The drug molecules are called inhibitors of ubiquitin specific proteases.
They block the activity of an important cancer pathway which is believed to play a key role in tumour development.
Tim Harrison, vice president of drug discovery at Almac, said they have been "a highly sought after, yet elusive drug class, proving difficult to identify despite significant efforts from both pharmaceutical and biotech companies".
He added that there was now "an exciting opportunity to fully exploit this novel biology".
Genentech was founded in San Francisco in 1976 and is widely considered to be the world's most successful biotechnology company.
It has developed products such as the cancer drug Avastin and the stroke treatment Activase.
In 2009, the Swiss drug company Roche took control of Genentech, paying £30bn for the 44% of the firm it did not own.
Meanwhile, California-based CV6 Therapeutics Ltd is to partner with the Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology at Queen's University, Belfast for a research and development project.
The project aims to develop a new drug with the potential to make chemotherapy more effective and represents a total investment of £5.5m.
Invest NI has offered assistance of £2.5m towards the project, which includes part funding from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).

===Input Doc/Src: In the past five years, 17,982 complaints have been lodged with the county's borough and district councils.
Of those, 3,454 relate to dogs barking, the BBC Radio Suffolk Freedom of Information request found.
Seven thousand complaints were made about loud music and parties, while church bells have led to 10 complaints to councils.
Other complaints were made about bird scarers in fields, machinery and vehicle noise, and people shouting or talking loudly.

Ipswich Borough Council received the highest number of complaints over the five years, with 4,568.
Waveney District Council received 3,672 complaints, while Suffolk Coastal District Council had a total of just over 3,000.
Mark Johnson, senior public health officer at St Edmundsbury Borough Council, said the best thing for people to do was to speak with the person making the noise.
"It's the most common sense approach because sometimes they don't even realise they're causing a nuisance to their neighbours," he said.
As for dogs, Candice Rose, owner of Canine Creche in Martlesham, said they could be taught not to bark.
"The key thing is reward and distraction," she said. "We distract them and then reward the good behaviour.
"There are solutions, it could be a behavioural issue, in which case that can be adjusted, but if it's just through boredom - there really is no excuse in this day and age."

===Input Doc/Src: Scientists are recruiting 64 healthy adult volunteers for the trial, which is expected to take up to two years.
The work will be split equally between London, the Rwandan capital Kigali and Nairobi in Kenya.
This early trial is being run by the International Aids Vaccine Initiative (IAVI), a non-profit organisation.
The principal investigator, Dr Jill Gilmour, who has worked at the laboratory at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital since its founding in 2001, says she is optimistic that the Aids virus can eventually be tackled with a vaccine.
The virus is now 30 years old, and the search for a vaccine has proved elusive so far.
However, an American-backed trial in Thailand found in 2009 that a combination of two vaccine prototypes was 30% effective in preventing HIV infection.
Follow-up trials are being planned with the aim of improving those initial results.
In the IAVI trial, volunteers who are free of HIV and not at risk of catching the infection will receive a combination of two vaccines.
One of them is derived from a weakened version of Sendai, a flu-like virus that infects rodents. It will be administered through nasal drops.
This is because in the early stages of infection, both HIV and Sendai affect the mucosal tissues, which are found in the nose and also in the genital area.
Dr Gilmour said: "I believe it's not if, it's when we will have an effective HIV vaccine. There is now strong scientific data to support that position.
"We will get there but vaccine development takes time. It's not for the faint-hearted.
"Bear in mind that with polio, it was 45 years from discovering the virus to getting an effective vaccine.
"HIV is a formidable beast with sneaky tricks. It changes every time it divides, so it's highly variable. And it can integrate into your own cells, so your immune system can't see it."
The trial is early work known as Phase I, meaning that the aim is to ensure the vaccine is safe and induces an immune response.
Dr Gilmour added: "Delivering the vacci

===Input Doc/Src: The Belfast woman claims she was 15 when she embarked on a sexual relationship with Mr McPeake.
The 72-year-old denies 12 counts of sex offences against her.
She made her claim during her third day in the witness box.
The abuse is alleged to have happened from summer 2009 until February 2010.
She alleged in Belfast Crown Court she became sexually involved with McPeake during a group trip to the Republic of Ireland, and that when the group returned to Belfast, her relationship with Mr McPeake progressed onto intercourse.
The woman was questioned at length about the allegations she had made against Mr McPeake.
When she was asked about an alleged pregnancy scare, the woman said she "panicked" as she was only 15 and that Mr McPeake had lost his temper when she told him.
This, and all her other claims, have been refuted by Mr McPeake, who makes the case that no sexual activity occurred between him and the then schoolgirl in 2009 and 2010.
A defence lawyer questioned the woman about her claims of sexual activity on two cross-border trips as well as alleged incidents she said occurred at the McPeake School of Music in Belfast, at another music workshop in the city and in his car.
Telling the jury it was Mr McPeake's case there was no sexual activity, the lawyer accused the woman of being a disruptive influence during one of the cross-border trips, where she made a nuisance of herself and had to be chastised by Mr McPeake for her bad behaviour.
This suggestion was rejected by the woman, who said that at that time they were in a relationship and she was in love with him.
She was also asked about comments she made about wanting to wreck his life the way he had wrecked hers, and also comments she made to Mr McPeake's son via Facebook about his father.
Breaking down in tears, the woman said she was "angry and hurt" about what Mr McPeake had done.
She said: "All I wanted was an apology, to say he was sorry and that he was wrong. I just wanted an apology from him."

===Input Doc/Src: Mr Davies said it was time to change the name in recognition of the primary law making powers it was granted in a 2011 referendum.
The Welsh word used for the assembly building is Senedd, which translates into English as "parliament".
But the Wales Office indicated that the move was "not a priority".
A spokesman for the Wales Office said any change in the name of the National Assembly would require changes to primary legislation.
Mr Davies, leader of the Conservative group in the National Assembly, the second largest party to Labour, describes himself as a "proud unionist".
He said his suggestion had nothing to do with any greater separation between Wales and the rest of the UK.
He said the move, which he claims would require only a small amendment in existing legislation to be in place by 2016, would be "a statement about the institution which now legislates for our great nation".
Mr Davies, the South Wales Central AM, said: "By voting for full law-making powers last year the people of Wales made their National Assembly a parliament in all but name.
"It's now time to reward their faith in our institution and acknowledge that where laws are made - the title of a parliament should exist. This is a common-sense move.
"It would provide far greater clarity over the distinction between the assembly - as it is currently named - and the Welsh government, and it would give our devolved institution its rightful place alongside other national legislatures.
"As we drive forward it is crucially important that we embrace what we now have. Put simply - a parliament."
ANALYSIS by Adrian Browne, BBC Wales political reporter
Andrew RT Davies' suggestion that the National Assembly should be rebranded as the Welsh Parliament would appear to be aimed at attracting Plaid Cymru voters who might, he hopes, be uneasy about the leadership of Leanne Wood, who is up front about her socialist and republican beliefs.
It could also be seen as an attempt to assert his authority within his party.

===Input Doc/Src: The isle is a mile long (16.km), depending on tides and weather, and separated from the mainland by a (330ft) 100 metre wide channel.
It was first spotted by locals as a "bump" above the water in April, according to the Island Free Press.
Photos taken by a Connecticut tourist have gone viral on Instagram, leading to a boost in curious visitors.
Photographer Chad Koczera described encountering the island during his visit to Cape Point.
"My fiancee and I were driving to the point after a storm to collect shells when we spotted an area we couldn't get to by car," he said.
He described returning for his fifth time to the park, and to visit Cape Point where he had proposed marriage to his then-girlfriend.
"I sent the drone up to check it out and noticed this beautiful island. We didn't get a chance to make it on to the island because of the strong current."
The island is littered with old shipwrecks and whale bones that poke through its sands, says local historian Danny Couch.
Experts say the shores of the Outer Banks are constantly shifting, as sandbars rise above or sink back below the water.
Park superintendent Dave Hallac has cautioned visitors against trying to swim or walk across the channel to reach the island.
Currents can swiftly carry away a person, while sharks and sting rays have been spotted in the area.
Visitors are advised to use a kayak or paddleboard to reach Hatteras Island, as it's been dubbed.

Walker was unexpectedly joined by Maria de Cezar while presenting live on BBC Four from Copacabana beach, and after she joined him for an impromptu on-air chat to discuss her wedding, she has invited him to next month's ceremony.
It comes hot on the heels of FOUR marriage proposals at the Rio Games, meaning Maria's is not the only 'Olympic wedding' on the horizon.
Romance was in the air at the individual dressage on Monday, as Briton Charlotte Dujardin not only retained her title but received a proposal - of sorts - from fiance Dean Golding.
Watching Dujardin from the stands, he wore a sign that read: "Can we get married now?"
After winning gold, Dujardin told BBC Radio 5 live: "He's already asked me. He knows it's 'yes'.
"I'm hopefully going to get married next year. I said I would get married after London but time just flew by. It's definitely on the cards now."
Cupid then found British race walker Tom Bosworth at the Copacabana.
The 26-year-old almost pulled off a shock when he led the 20km walk at the halfway stage, before finishing sixth. On Monday, he surprised boyfriend Harry Dineley with a marriage proposal.
Bosworth's was the third proposal of the Rio Games.
On Sunday, Chinese diver He Zi had just been awarded her women's 3m springboard silver when boyfriend and fellow diver Qin Kai proposed in front of a stunned arena.
She nodded.

The first proposal of the Games came during the first week, when Olympic rugby sevens venue worker Marjorie Enya asked Brazil player Isadora Cerullo to marry her.

A colleague told a disciplinary hearing Mr Colella had returned to the ambulance with two "full bags of shopping" after 20 minutes.
He did not attend the hearing.
Giving evidence to the Health and Care Professionals Council, fellow paramedic Yvonne Purves said the elderly man had passed out in M&S and then regained consciousness before being moved into Mr Colella's ambulance.
She told the panel she had wondered where her colleague had gone after waiting for some time in the ambulance.
"The wife was understandably anxious about what had happened to her husband and was wondering why we weren't leaving to go to hospital," she said.
"He then came back with two full bags of shopping and loaded them in to the front of the ambulance and flippantly said 'do you want to go to hospital then?'.
"Obviously, I wanted to go to hospital some time ago. I waited 20 minutes for Mr Colella while alone in the ambulance," she added.
On another occasion, Mr Colella is alleged to have got a hair cut instead of taking a head injury patient to hospital.
The panel heard Mr Colella, who faces two counts of misconduct, did not turn up at the hearing because he was working.
He has since resigned from the London Ambulance Service.

===Input Doc/Src: The NSPCC twice referred Charito Cruz to social services at Kingston Council because of Mohammed Asad Niazi's abuse.
In December Niazi, 30, was found guilty of bludgeoning Ms Cruz to death with a hammer in 2011 and jailed for 12 years.
The council said it was now conducting a "domestic homicide review".
An Ofsted report said the council had not adequately addressed "all the areas identified" in its internal management review, which has never been published but has been seen by BBC London.
Duncan Clark, Kingston's director of children and learning, resigned with a Â£128,000 pay-off the day before the Ofsted report was published.
The internal review found on one occasion a social services manager did not think the referral was serious enough to warrant a home visit.
On the second occasion in September 2011 the manager did not read the referrals but took the documents home to read.
That night, Niazi killed 37-year-old Ms Cruz by hitting her 50 times with a hammer.
The council, Mr Clark and two social work managers criticised in the internal review have refused to comment.
Kingston Council would only say it was conducting a "domestic homicide review" into the case, that new senior managers had been appointed and a "significant investment" had been made.
A council spokesman said: "A number of significant actions have been taken in response to the findings of the Ofsted inspection and the improvement notice in order to improve safeguarding arrangements for children.
"The council is implementing the improvement plan and there is good progress on delivering this agenda."
Kingston's former acting head of social care, Olivia Butler, who ordered the internal investigation into what went wrong, said what she uncovered was "very poor practice and tantamount to negligence".

===Input Doc/Src: Scotland was classed as "average" for the first time in a major international study of education.
Meanwhile, the Scottish government is carrying out a major review of school governance.
So just how are schools and the education system run at the moment?
In a nutshell, there is a national school system in Scotland which councils are responsible for delivering.
School buildings are the responsibility of councils - they decide how many schools are needed and where they should be built, open or closed, although they have to observe national rules and guidance.
The system for closing rural schools was overhauled a few years ago. The government also helps fund some new school buildings through its Schools for the Future programme.
Councils also employ teachers and decide how many there should be. However the Scottish government took steps to reverse the long-term decline in teacher numbers across Scotland.
This year, teacher numbers were maintained or rose in 20 of Scotland's 32 council areas.
The most recent funding deal with local government made it plain that the government expected the ratio of teachers to pupils to be maintained. This happened in all but 12 areas.
However, councils are currently responsible for deciding just how much to spend on schools overall - this could be set to change.
The government intends to hold a consultation a "national funding formula" for schools. It also plans to give Â£100m straight to head teachers from next year.
This all fits into a bigger debate about school governance. The question is over just what powers individual head teachers should have, what powers councils should retain and what powers should be given to planned new regional education boards which will work across council boundaries.
The consultation closes on 6 January.
Two national agencies also have important responsibilities - the Scottish Qualifications Authority and Education Scotland.
The SQA is, by far, the better known to the public. Because of its profile, its s

===Input Doc/Src: Saracens - serial winners with a cult-like collective mentality - take on Clermont Auvergne, whose sublime individual talents have too often been big-day bridesmaids.
Often in major finals, the only fireworks on the pitch are when the winning captain lifts the trophy. But both these teams are capable of scintillating rugby to light up Murrayfield.
It will be one to relish.
There is a paradox around this Saracens team.
They have been in the shake-down for major honours for the past five years. Last season, they landed a Premiership-Champions Cup double.
Yet when you read down their teamsheet, it is not the scary set of individual superstars that big-money French sides in particular have put together in this competition's past.
I suspect that is exactly how they like it. Saracens' success has been based around putting the team first.
But that approach can't disguise the fact that fly-half Owen Farrell is fast becoming world class - if he is not there already.
When he initially emerged at Saracens, his game was based on his excellent distribution and dead-eyed place kicking. Now he has so much more.
His passing is sharper, his tactical kicking is more varied, he is a threat when he runs with the ball in hand and, if he doesn't go through a gap himself, he has the sleight of hand to put a team-mate into one.
Opposite him, as in England's narrow Six Nations win over France earlier this year, is Camille Lopez.
Lopez does not have either the flourishes or the fragility you sometimes associate with French fly-halves.
He was excellent in the semi-final win over Leinster, controlling the tempo of the match and minimising mistakes, and if Clermont are to win, Lopez will have to lead them to victory again.
The French side will not be able to outmuscle Saracens. Instead Clermont will have to beat them at their own game, by kicking often and smartly, defending stoutly and backing themselves to be sharper at exploiting the chances when they come.
That puts a lot of pressure on Lop

===Input Doc/Src: Referee Rajindraparsad Seechurn gave Equatorial Guinea a controversial penalty in stoppage time as they beat Tunisia 2-1 in the quarter-finals.
Tunisia staff confronted the official after the match and their federation has been fined $50,000 (£33,000).
"The referees committee noted the poor performance of the referee," the Confederation of African Football said.
Caf added that the referee's failings included an "unacceptable failure to maintain calm and ensure proper control of the players during the match".
Caf also wants an apology from Tunisia for accusations of bias.
And Tunisia have been ordered to pay for damages to a door and a refrigerator in the team's dressing room at Bata Stadium.
Mauritian referee Seechurn awarded the penalty in stoppage time after Ali Maaloul was harshly ruled to have fouled Ivan Bolado when Tunisia were leading 1-0 and, after equalising from the spot through Javier Balboa, hosts Equatorial Guinea went on to win in extra-time.
Seechurn has also been removed from Caf's list of elite referees.
According to Caf, it was sent two letters by the Tunisian FA following the match, with the second asking for an investigation and suggesting that Caf and its officials "were questionable and biased against Tunisia in general".
Unless Tunisia's football federation can provide "irrefutable evidence to substantiate the accusations" they need to send a letter of apology by midnight on 5 February or face expulsion from the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations.
Tunisia football chief Wadie Jary resigned from Caf in protest after the match and he was also "condemned" for his behaviour after going on to the pitch to confront Seechurn, as well as criticising the referee and African football's governing body.
Equatorial Guinea were fined $5,000 (£3,300) for poor security at the stadium.

===Input Doc/Src: Maylis de Kerangal is the first French author to win the Â£30,000 award, which honours books of any genre that has a central theme of health or medicine.
It is the first translated text to win and only the second novel to win in the award's history.
Head judge Val McDermid called it "compelling, original and ambitious".
Described as "a heart-breaking and gripping story of life-saving medical science" it follows the story of Simon Limbeau's heart.
He heads out on a surfing trip with two friends but they crash their van on the way home and he is left brain dead but with a beating heart.
His family then face the tough decision whether to donate his heart.
The book depicts the "24-hour whirlwind of trauma and death, life and hope" and ends when the heart starts to beat in the body of someone else.
This year's Chair of Judges, Val McDermid, announced the winner at a ceremony at the Wellcome Collection in London on Monday.
"Mend the Living is a metaphorical and lyrical exploration of the journey of one heart and two bodies," she said.
"Over 24 hours we travel from trauma to hope, discovering both the humane aspect of organ donation and the internal dramas of those affected by it.
"Compelling, original and ambitious, this novel illuminates what it is to be human."
Mend the Living is de Kerangal's fifth novel. She has won previous awards in France for her novel Birth of a Bridge and her novella Tangente vers l'est.
It was translated by Jessica Moore, an award-winning translator, songwriter and poet based in Montreal.
The book has already been adapted into a film by French film director Katell Quillevere, which will open in UK cinemas from 28 April.

===Input Doc/Src: A petrol bomb was thrown at a house at Thornhill Crescent, at about 02:45 BST on Sunday. A man and a woman in the property were not injured.
A window was broken at a property at Cloona Manor just before 00:45 BST and a device was thrown at the front door. It caused minor damage.
It is unclear if anyone was in that house at the time.
A second unexploded petrol bomb was found in the driveway of the house at Cloona Manor. It has been taken away for forensic examination.
The police said they were also investigating  a report of arson at the same property in Thornhill Crescent  at about the same time as the petrol bomb attack.
It was reported that a silver Vauxhall Zafira was set alight in the area.
No-one is believed to have been injured during the arson attack, but the vehicle was extensively damaged.
Ch Insp John Wilson said:  "Enquiries are continuing, but at this stage police are investigating a possible link between an earlier incident that occurred at the Cloona Manor area and the incidents at Thornhill Crescent."
Speaking about the Cloona Manor attack, Sinn FÃ©in MLA Jennifer McCann said: "Attacks like this can lead to serious injury or death and it's very worrying that anyone targeted this elderly man's home in this way.
"If anyone has information on who was behind this attack, then they should give it to the police immediately."
SDLP Lisburn councillor Brian Heading said the Cloona Manor attack was "reckless and dangerous".
"Anybody who throws petrol bombs at a home is attempting murder. There can be no justification of that," he said.
"I'm urging those who carried out the deed to think long and hard and ask themselves what they have achieved and turn themselves into the police."
Police have appealed for witnesses.

===Input Doc/Src: While the City of London tends to grab more headlines, Edinburgh is the UK's second largest financial centre, employing thousands of people in financial services.
Where will banks, investors, brokers, lawyers and accountants choose to ply their trade if the UK were split?
"If in doubt, people may say they don't want to take the risk - they gravitate to London, where more deals can be done," says Prof Ranald Michie of the University of Durham, a financial historian who has studied the City of London for 35 years.
Financial firms have fewer physical constraints to consider compared to a shipyard or a distillery. And they're likely to move to where they can find other companies to provide the advice and services they need, and where they can recruit skilled staff in the greatest abundance, says Prof Michie.
Scottish lender Royal Bank of Scotland has said it will move its legal centre to London in the event of a Yes vote, but has no plans to move jobs.
Banks like RBS already have large offices in London they can simply nominate as their new head office, says Peter Hahn, a former Citigroup banker who is now a senior lecturer at Cass Business School.
"Many of these companies are really run from London anyway."
But for Scotland independence could also create opportunities.
"What has grown up in Edinburgh is fund management and insurance," says Prof Michie. "For them, the gravitational pull of London is much, much less -  Scotland has cheaper rents, cheaper labour. But they have done well tapping business in the UK, so they would need to try to keep that."
Edinburgh could create a business environment to suit its strengths and attract more insurers and asset managers, he says.
"But it will be difficult to stop other cities and financial centres doing the same."
But the City of London stands to gain too in the event of independence, according to Sir Martin Jacomb, former chairman of insurer Prudential and of BZW, Barclays' first foray into investment banking.

===Input Doc/Src: If all over-30s followed recommended guidelines on exercise, nearly 3,000 lives could be saved each year in Australia alone, say researchers.
More needs to be done to warn women of inactivity, as it outweighs other risk factors such as obesity, they say.
Lack of exercise is a known major risk factor for heart disease, says the British Heart Foundation.
A team at the University of Queensland, Australia tracked the health of more than 30,000 women born in the 1920s, 1940s and 1970s.
They found smoking had the greatest impact on women's heart disease risk below the age of 30.
However, as women got older and more gave up smoking, it was overtaken by physical inactivity as the dominant influence on heart disease risk.
Continuing efforts to encourage people to stop smoking were warranted, the researchers reported in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.
But they said greater effort were needed to promote exercise, which they describe as a "Cinderella" risk factor compared with obesity.
"We need a lot more effort to keep middle-aged women active and then keep them active into old age," Prof Wendy Brown, of the university's centre for research on exercise, physical activity and health, told BBC News.
"If you can do at least 30 minutes and preferably 45 minutes a day, you'll see huge improvements in your health and reduce your risk of heart disease by half."
According to NHS Choices, adults aged 19-64 years are recommended to do 150 minutes of weekly physical activity, or 30 minutes on five days a week.
Commenting on the study, Thembi Nkala, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said physical inactivity was a known major risk factor for heart disease.
"Interestingly, this study shows its dominant influence on heart disease amongst women, and suggests a greater need to promote regular physical activity amongst this group," she said.
"It's important to remember that heart disease is linked to other factors such as smoking, obesity, high blood pressure and hig

===Input Doc/Src: The South Stream pipeline, financed by Russia's state gas giant Gazprom, would ship gas to western Europe via the Balkans, thus avoiding Ukraine.
But the European Commission says the pipeline may break EU competition rules and asked Bulgaria to suspend work.
Serbia's prime minister has denied his country has also halted building work.
Reports on Sunday had quoted Serbian ministers as saying the work was on hold until the EU, Russia and Bulgaria resolved their dispute.
But speaking on Monday, Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic said no such decision had been made.
Serbia is in talks with the EU on joining the bloc. Bulgaria is already an EU member state.
Construction work on the South Stream pipeline began in Bulgaria in October 2013.
It is intended to deliver Russian gas to southern Europe without passing through Ukraine and if built, it would deliver 63 billion cubic metres of natural gas a year.
The project was initiated amid disagreements between Gazprom and Ukraine and Belarus over the pricing of Russian gas, which led to gas supplies to some parts of Europe being cut off. It took on added significance following the upheaval in Ukraine.
But the European Commission says Bulgaria may have broken EU public procurement laws by choosing local and Russian bidders for its part of the pipeline, and earlier this month, asked Bulgaria to stop work.
On Monday, Russia's EU envoy Vladimir Chizhov said the move by Brussels was a "creeping shift to economic sanctions against Russia".
"It is hard to shake off the feeling that the European Commission's blocking of the start of work on the construction of Bulgaria's key section of South Stream has been done for purely political purposes," Russia's Itar-Tass news agency quoted him as saying.
Bulgaria has previously said it is being targeted by Brussels as a means of retaliating against Russia over the situation in Ukraine.

===Input Doc/Src: The National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) registered "brief increases" in hate crime reports following attacks at Westminster, Manchester and London Bridge, but not after Finsbury Park.
The incidents were reported to forces in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
NPCC hate crime lead, Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton, said reports "quickly subsided within a few days".
There have been four terror attacks in Britain in 2017 - at Westminster Bridge in London on 22 March, Manchester Arena on 22 May, London Bridge on 3 June and at Finsbury Park in London on 19 June.
Police recorded 234 hate crime incidents two days after the Westminster attack, 273 reports two days after Manchester and 319 reports two days after London Bridge.
Police said in 2016 there were on average 171 hate crimes per day - although this could be higher on weekends, where more hate crimes tended to be reported, or after specific events such as protest marches.
In the week after each attack, hate crime reports increased by 12% after Westminster, 50% after Manchester and 34% after London Bridge.
By contrast, hate crime reports were 7% lower in the week after the Finsbury Park attack, the NPCC said.
Police said race or faith hate crime comprised the vast majority of reports.
But the NPCC added that analysis of the data was "ongoing" and that year-on-year comparisons should be viewed with caution - last year, for example, hate crime reports increased after the EU referendum vote in June.
ACC Hamilton said the figures were nevertheless a "real concern for the police service and wider society".
He said: "We know that terrorist attacks and other national and global events have the potential to trigger short-term spikes in hate crime and so we have been carefully monitoring community tensions following recent horrific events.
"As terrorists seek to divide us, it is more important than ever that we continue to stand united in the face of hostility and hatred."

The home team led 13-0 after 28 minutes thanks to Conor Murray's try and eight points from the boot of Johnny Sexton.
But Wales hit back with Taulupe Faletau's try converted by replacement fly-half Rhys Priestland, whose 72nd-minute penalty edged Wales 16-13 ahead.
Sexton's third penalty squared things and Priestland's late drop-goal attempt was off target in a breathless finale.
With the clock in the red and fans' nerves shredded, both teams strove for the decisive score rather than settle for the draw.
But the defences held out and when referee Jerome Garces finally called a halt, there was a collective exhaling of breath around the ground.
It means Wales have not won back-to-back games in Ireland since 2000, while the Irish dream of a third consecutive title has not been fatally damaged.
But Grand Slams and Triple Crowns will have to wait for another season after a first draw between the two sides in Dublin since 1974.
With Ireland having lost Sean O'Brien and Rob Kearney in the week, Wales had to draft Liam Williams in at full-back after Gareth Anscombe's late withdrawal.
And within 20 minutes replacement fly-half Priestland was on after Dan Biggar limped off with a foot injury.
The Irish dominated the first half hour, with Wales unable to maintain possession and struggling to keep debutant CJ Stander and Tommy O'Donnell in check.
Scrum-half Murray was the beneficiary as he dummied over from close range to help establish a 13-0 lead.
But Priestland's boot, and Faletau's opportunism after the ball squirted out of an advancing scrum, somehow saw Wales back within three points at the break, and the boots of the fly-halves ensured the game ended level after a nerve-shredding second half.
Wales' dominance at the scrum was the cornerstone of their fightback, but Ireland looked more creative behind and with Stander and Jamie Heaslip outstanding in the back row, met Wales' predominantly physical challenge head-on.

===Input Doc/Src: They identified bacteria able to shrug off the drug of last resort - colistin - in patients and livestock in China.
They said that resistance would spread around the world and raised the spectre of untreatable infections.
It is likely resistance emerged after colistin was overused in farm animals.
Bacteria becoming completely resistant to treatment - also known as the antibiotic apocalypse - could plunge medicine back into the dark ages.
Common infections would kill once again, while surgery and cancer therapies, which are reliant on antibiotics, would be under threat.
Chinese scientists identified a new mutation, dubbed the MCR-1 gene, that prevented colistin from killing bacteria.
The report in the Lancet Infectious Diseases showed resistance in a fifth of animals tested, 15% of raw meat samples and in 16 patients.
And the resistance had spread between a range of bacterial strains and species, including E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
There is also evidence that it has spread to Laos and Malaysia.
Prof Timothy Walsh, who collaborated on the study, from the University of Cardiff, told the BBC News website: "All the key players are now in place to make the post-antibiotic world a reality.
"If MCR-1 becomes global, which is a case of when not if, and the gene aligns itself with other antibiotic resistance genes, which is inevitable, then we will have very likely reached the start of the post-antibiotic era.
"At that point if a patient is seriously ill, say with E. coli, then there is virtually nothing you can do."
Resistance to colistin has emerged before.
However, the crucial difference this time is the mutation has arisen in a way that is very easily shared between bacteria.
"The transfer rate of this resistance gene is ridiculously high, that doesn't look good," said Prof Mark Wilcox, from Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust.
His hospital is now dealing with multiple cases "where we're struggling to find an antibiotic" every month - an ev

He had previously been manager of both Scunthorpe United and Brighton.
During his playing career, he was a wing-half for Matt Busby's United, then Leeds before finishing at Scunthorpe.
As one of the Busby Babes, he made his first team breakthrough at Old Trafford following the Munich Air Disaster in 1958.
He played in the first game after Munich, just a fortnight later, when the team-sheet in the programme was famously left blank for the club's FA Cup fifth-round win over Sheffield Wednesday.
And he was in the rebuilt United team all the way to Wembley, where they lost 2-0 to local rivals Bolton Wanderers.
Heywood-born Goodwin also played first-class cricket over two summers, making 11 appearances as a fast bowler for his native Lancashire, in which he took a career-best 5-35 against Middlesex at Lord's in June 1955.
After leaving Birmingham in 1975, Goodwin took up an offer to move to the then burgeoning North American Soccer League, where he had two spells as coach, then club president of the Minnesota Kicks.

And Tierney could continue there against England at Hampden on 10 June.
"It's up to the gaffer, whatever he thinks is best and whatever he thinks the team that is going to give us the best chance of winning," said Tierney.
Scotland had been left short at right-back after Alan Hutton retired from international football and Callum Paterson suffered cruciate ligament damage.
Derby County winger Ikechi Anya had impressed at right-back against England and Canada.
But, as Hull City's Andy Robertson revealed after the 1-0 win over Slovenia, head coach Gordon Strachan decided to move one of his three left-backs over to the left.

Rangers' Lee Wallace missed out through injury, Robertson was chosen on the left and Strachan showed his faith in 19-year-old Tierney for a debut in the right-back role.
"I have been training there all week, so I had a feeling I'd be playing there," said Tierney, who was winning his third Scotland cap.
"The manager and the coaching staff have been giving me pointers. I enjoyed it."
Strachan said before the game that his side needed three points to retain hopes of qualifying for the 2018 finals in Russia.
Instead, the victory moved the Scots two points off second-top Slovakia and gave them a fighting chance of making a play-off.
It was a big occasion for Tierney's Celtic team-mate, Stuart Armstrong, to win his first cap and the midfielder responded by setting up Chris Martin's 88th-minute winning goal four days before his 25th birthday.
Asked about his role in the winner, the former Dundee United player said: "It feels good, but what feels better is to have contributed in a positive way to three points, which we needed to put us in a very good position in the group," he said.

===Input Doc/Src: I've downloaded an episode of David Attenborough's Frozen Planet in about a minute and viewed YouTube videos in the middle of London without a hint of buffering.
I've even tested a live broadcast using nothing but a laptop connected to a mobile phone network. All of this has been thanks to 4G - a technology which is already being rolled out in many parts of the world but won't be widely available in the UK until 2013 at the earliest.
Two big 4G trials are underway at the moment. In London, O2 has launched a test network covering various parts of the centre of town, and soon out to Canary Wharf and the Docklands.
In Cornwall, BT and Everything Everywhere - formerly known as Orange and T-Mobile - have begun testing 4G under very different conditions. The aim there is to work out whether part of the spectrum which is being auctioned late next year will provide a mobile broadband alternative for people who struggle to get a decent service down a fixed line.
Now I can already hear the purists shouting that neither of these trials are "real 4G".

So far, these speeds look impressive, although you have to bear in mind that once the new networks are clogged up with thousands of users, they are bound to slow down.

The city council also is bidding for an additional £3.5m in funding from the Department of Transport.
"The Charles Street station is a disgrace - it is not good enough because it's cramped and inconvenient," Mayor Sir Peter Soulsby said.
"It is just not good enough a modern city like Leicester.
"We have to make sure that travelling by bus to and from Leicester is a realistic and attractive choice."
A council spokesman said the project would "help ease bus congestion and queuing" at the station.

===Input Doc/Src: According to a pair of scientific studies, key genes in the immune system come from our ancient "cousins".
The findings, which appear in The American Journal of Human Genetics, suggest we have Neanderthals to thank for being able to fight off pathogens.
But interbreeding may have had a downside, as the same genes may have made us more prone to allergies.
Modern-day people can trace their ancestry to a small population that emerged from Africa about 60,000 years ago.
As the African humans spread out across the world, they came into contact with other ancient humans based in Europe and Western Asia.
Genetic evidence suggests that these different "tribes" interbred, with part of the genome of Neanderthals still present in humans alive today.
About 1% to 6% of the modern Eurasian human genome seems to come from Neanderthals and Denisovans - another extinct member of the human family.
Scientists in Germany analysed the genes of both modern humans and our ancient relatives to find the source of changes in our immune system's genetic blueprints.
They found some of the fragments of Neanderthal DNA in humans alive today play a key role in the immune system as the front line of defence against pathogens such as bacteria, fungi and parasites.
"The evidence suggests that this genetic region contributes to the immune system of modern day humans," Dr Michael Dannemann of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, told BBC News.
"At some point in history it might have been an advantage to have these Neanderthal genes in terms of fighting off infections or lethal pathogens from 10,000 years ago.
"It could also still be an advantage today but this is difficult to pinpoint."
Dr Danneman, a co-researcher on one of the papers, said this inheritance from the Neanderthals could also have left some people more prone to allergies - because of the effect on the immune system - although this needs further investigation in the laboratory.

The 22-year-old committed suicide at her home in Stafford in August 2015.
She was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, an inquest ruled last month.
After her death, her family said Hannah "could well be here today if things had been dealt with differently."
Ch Supt Jon Drake of Staffordshire Police said: "After we received the allegation of rape, specially-trained officers conducted an investigation into the incident.
"They did their best to support Hannah while the investigation progressed, but tragically, Hannah took her own life.
"Following a review by the Crown Prosecution Service, Elgan Varney of Wye Road, Newcastle, was charged with rape."
A statement from Hannah's family said: "Hannah's death has left a sense of loss that is impossible to put into words.
"We will remember her as a beautiful daughter who loved life, enjoyed spending time with her friends and family and was passionate about helping others.

===Input Doc/Src: About 12 students stormed the offices of LSE director, Sir Howard Davies Students and 150 held a rally outside.
The LSE says it is reconsidering links with Libya "as a matter of urgency".
But the students demanded the university paid back the £300,000 it had accepted of a £1.5m grant from a charity wing of the regime.
The grant was pledged in 2009 by the Gaddafi International Charity and Development Foundation.
The funds have so far been used to develop a research programme on North Africa, focused on politics, economics and society.
The student demonstrators called on the LSE management to "repay" the £300,000 already spent by creating a scholarship fund for underprivileged Libyan students.
The students also urged the university to revoke the LSE alumni status of Libyan leader Col Gaddafi's second son Saif al-Islam, who studied at the university from 2003 to 2008, gaining both a Master of Science degree and a doctorate.
They called for a public commitment that no grants from officials "of such oppressive regimes" would be accepted in the future, as well as a public statement  denouncing the recent "gross violations of human rights" by the Gaddafi regime.
One of the protesters, Ashok Kumar, who is also education officer for the LSE students' union, said: "I think it's reprehensible that the university continues to benefit from money that was stolen from the Libyan people and it's only right to return it to the people who are now being murdered in the streets fighting for their freedom."
The money should be returned either as scholarships to underprivileged students, or "to the families of those who have been murdered and who continue to be murdered", he said.
In a statement, the university said the LSE Director "noted the message" from the  students.

The volunteers will arrive on the battlefield 950 years to the day since Harold fought William of Normandy.
Nigel Amos, leader of the march for English Heritage, said it was a "once-in-a-lifetime opportunity".
King Harold defeated a Viking army at the Battle of Stamford Bridge in East Yorkshire, on 25 September, 1066, before travelling south to face the Normans.
On 14 October, he fought and was killed at the Battle of Hastings.
William then seized the English throne.
Emily Sewell, head of events for English Heritage, said 1066 and the Battle of Hastings was "one of the most famous battles and most transformative years in English history".

The team from the Canada-France Hawaii Telescope inferred the dark matter's existence by the way it bends light.
The images were presented at the 219th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Austin, US.
The four images were taken at four different seasons of the year, each capturing a swath of the sky about as large as a palm held at arm's length.
They are a big step forward in understanding both dark matter itself, and the means by which dark matter influences the way normal matter clumps into the galaxies we see in the night skies.
Together, they represent the images of more than 10 million galaxies, whose light gives the only hints of the large-scale structure of dark matter.
BBC Universe: Dark matter
BBC Universe: Dark energy
"Light coming toward us from a distant galaxy is bent by the gravity of a lump of matter in the middle," explained Catherine Heymans of the University of Edinburgh.
"Einstein's theory of general relativity tells us that mass bends space and time, so when light comes toward us through the Universe, if it passes some dark matter, its light gets bent and the image we see gets bent and distorted," Dr Heymans told the meeting.
"Dark matter is leaving its signature on the images of very distant galaxies."
The survey is some 100 times larger than the previous largest map of the web of dark matter, gathered by the Hubble telescope's Cosmic Evolution Survey, or Cosmos.
In the new image, the full-scale distribution of vast clumps of dark matter can be seen around galaxy clusters, connected by wispy filaments of dark matter and trailing off to enormous voids where no matter exists.
Thankfully for theoretical astrophysicists, these images line up neatly with theory.

===Input Doc/Src: The company is to make Inchinnan, near Glasgow Airport, a Centre of Competence for making aerofoils and engine shafts.
The specialist unit will provide parts for aero-engines which have gone out of volume production, meaning it requires flexible skills in making bespoke items.
It is expected that 130 roles will be created.
The company said this would partly offset the loss of almost 190 jobs announced in March.
While Rolls-Royce has faced big challenges in adjusting to market changes, with repeated profit warnings, it is consolidating its operations.
It currently has 54,000 employees in more than 50 countries, making and servicing aero-engines for airlines, ships and military use. Last year, it had turnover of more than £14bn.
Mike Mosley, chief operating officer for the supply chain division at the Derby-based firm, said: "Our investment in Inchinnan demonstrates our commitment to innovative technology and world-class facilities which will improve performance and drive profitable growth for our business.
"We recognise the dedication and flexibility of the Inchinnan workforce who continue to play a key role in the success of Rolls-Royce."
Rolls-Royce initially invested £85m in the Inchinnan plant.
In a statement, the company said the investment would "potentially" offset the impact of job reductions announced earlier this year as part of the restructuring of its aerospace division.
Renfrewshire Council said the investment was a "vote of confidence" in the Inchinnan plant.
Council leader Mark Macmillan added: "For a world-leading manufacturer to choose Renfrewshire as a focus for further investment is also a tremendous boost for the Renfrewshire economy.
"Renfrewshire has a proud engineering and manufacturing heritage and Rolls-Royce has been at the forefront of that."
In March, Rolls-Royce announced that it was going to shed 187 of the 700 jobs at Inchinnan.

===Input Doc/Src: On Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Dyson called for an easing of immigration laws to keep more overseas engineers.
He also said he would vote to leave the EU to avoid being "dominated and bullied by the Germans".
The firm has committed £1bn to 100 new products over four years.
"Export is vital for Britain to create wealth," said founder and chairman James Dyson. "In order to export you have to have high technology products that are better than those produced elsewhere in the world."
To boost UK research and development, engineers who come to study in UK universities should be encouraged to work in the UK after their course has finished, Mr Dyson said.
"One important thing we should do is to keep those engineers in Britain. A lot of them come from overseas, in fact, 90% of researchers at British universities come from overseas, and we must encourage them to stay here."
"I would change our immigration laws to allow the right sort of people to stay here," he said.
In addition, Mr Dyson said he didn't particularly want to stay in the EU.
"I think it's a European Union dominated by Germany, and in our particular field we have these very large German companies who dominate standards setting and energy reduction committees, and so we get the old guard and old technology supported and not new technology.
"I want to keep EFTA - European free trade - and free movement of peoples, but I don't see that we need to be dominated and bullied by the Germans."
Dyson's £1bn investment plan represents a significant increase in R&D spending at the company, which first made a name for itself selling bagless vacuum cleaners.
Since then it has produced fans, heaters and powerful hand dryers for public toilets.
Dyson also announced an extra £45m investment in research at UK universities.

The MCC said the new structure, which includes a 135-seat restaurant with views of the ground, will improve sight-lines and accessibility.
Work is set to begin on the Â£21m project at the end of the 2015 season.
The redevelopment must first be approved by the club's membership, with the committee set to seek approval at a special general meeting in the summer of 2015.
The current Warner Stand was built in 1958 and its replacement is the first phase of development in the 15-year Masterplan for Lord's, which was unveiled last May.
MCC chief executive Derek Brewer said the club "wants Lord's to be the world's finest cricket ground and this new stand combines the best in architecture with world-class facilities to help achieve that".
"Lord's celebrates its 200th birthday this year and we have a duty to ensure any changes made to the ground will stand the test of time and bring long-term benefits."

On Friday, Mr Carson reiterated his views about gun control.

Health Minister JP Nadda has urged people  not to panic and to wait for his ministry's report on the issue.
"I have told my officials to report to me on an urgent basis. There is no need to panic. Very soon we will come out with the [inquiry] report," he said.
Delhi-based environmental think-tank Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) said in its report that it had collected 38 bread and bakery samples from retail stores, bakeries and fast-food shops in Delhi for its study.
"More than 84% of samples tested were found to contain potassium bromate and/or iodate," it said.
The CSE has urged the government to ban the use of these chemicals in bakery products.

Selby dedicated his win to his late father, who died when he was 16.
"To beat Ronnie in the final to win my first world title is a dream come true," he added:
O'Sullivan said: "I tried my hardest but he was just too good,"
Selby, 30, is £300,000 richer for his Crucible triumph and is the ninth player to win the Triple Crown, having won three Masters titles and a UK Championship.

And even though Kerber was able to break immediately in the second set, Vandeweghe won four successive games from 3-2 down for the biggest win of her career.
"It was really special," she said. "Beating the world number one on any stage and any place is great. I'll take this one.
"I wasn't feeling confident - I guess I faked it. I was nervous, but I had a game plan to execute and I knew that as along as I kept picking my spots, I had a chance."

===Input Doc/Src: The company's decision last week to grant the equivalent of a 50% pay rise to six top executives sparked outrage.
Quebec's government agreed to a CA$1.34bn ($1bn; Â£800m) bailout in 2016, a year after it teetered on the edge of bankruptcy.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he was "not pleased" with the pay hike.
But he welcomed the change of heart.
Protesters gathered outside the firm's headquarters in Montreal on Sunday, hours before Bombardier relented and said the rises would be deferred to 2020.
They will be payable only if the firm achieved performance goals, it said.
"Over the past 75 years, our fellow citizens have always been by our side," said Bombardier chief executive Alain Bellemare on Sunday night.
"It is because of this deep relationship that we are sensitive to the public reaction to our executive compensation practices."
He was one of the six executives who were set to receive payments of CA$43.7m ($32.6m; Â£26.1m) in 2016.
That was up from CA$30m the year before, according to regulatory filings.
Bombardier originally justified the pay increases as a necessary measure to retain top talent.
But two Quebec cabinet ministers pressured the company last week to heed the backlash.
The Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard tweeted that he was "satisfied" with Sunday's climb-down by the firm.
The Quebec government last year invested CA$1.34bn in Bombardier's C-Series aircraft programme in return for a nearly 50% stake.
In February, the federal government agreed to give the company CA$372.5m in interest-free loans.
In 2016, Bombardier also announced lay-offs for 14,500 people, including about 20% of its workforce in Belfast.
The redundancies came as the firm secured orders with Delta Air Lines and Air Canada and made its maiden commercial voyage with Swiss Air Lines.

===Input Doc/Src: The Ministry of Public Security said 1,168 cultural relics worth more than 500m yuan ($80m; £52m) had been found.
The artefacts are thought to be illegally excavated in Niuheliang, a Neolithic archaeological site in north-eastern Liaoning province.
The ministry said the activities of the looters had severely damaged the site.
Among the artefacts was a coiled jade dragon, one of the earliest known depictions of the mythological creature, authorities said.
Unesco says the Niuheliang archaeological site, which dates back 5,500-5,000 years, was a burial and sacrificial centre in the late Hongshan period.
State media described the recovery as the biggest operation of its kind since the founding of modern China in 1949.
The date of the recovery operation was not provided, but the ministry said in a statement that 1,000 police officer were involved.
The looters were said to be split into 10 gangs that were responsible for everything from the excavation to the selling of the relics, according to China Daily.
Four archaeologists are also thought to be involved, the newspaper said.
"Artefacts are sold at a fast speed and traded frequently in a short time," said Cai Binghui, a police officer who was involved with the case according to China Daily.

The hospitals are not fully functioning, and IS is using them to treat its own fighters only. Civilians go to private clinics if they need to get treatment. This is of course very expensive. IS is forcing some of the doctors to stay at the hospitals to treat their fighters.
There are a number of civilians who are trying to leave towards Syria, but this only happens covertly.

I won't lie, I am scared too and I don't know if I am going to die in an air strike or killed by an IS fighter.

===Input Doc/Src: The Assembly Rooms, which opened in 1977, was badly damaged in a huge blaze that broke out in its roof car park last March.
The city council said rebuilding would be too expensive and the venue would be sold to a private company and could be knocked down and the site redeveloped.
As well as live music, the Assembly Rooms also hosted British Open snooker.
Perhaps its most famous musical moment was in 1983, when Morrissey was hit in the eye with a flower during a Smiths gig and fans invaded the stage at the end.
The venue also hosted performances from acts such as The Clash, Paul Weller and Manic Street Preachers and was home to the city's pantomime each year.
City council Labour leader Ranjit Banwait said he hoped the venue would be replaced with "some kind of cultural offer".
The opposition Conservative group said the local authority had dithered over the plans.
Councillor Robin Wood said the venue could have been kept "alive" in the interim until a bidder was found.
He said: "For over a year now we have been wondering what on earth is going to happen. Now we are told the wrecking ball is going to go at it.
"I think it would be much better to refurbish it and reopen it and look at other alternatives. What we will end up with is a pile of rubble and nothing."
Dave Parry, of the Derby Civic Society, said the venue was too big for the market place and never really achieved what it set out to do.
"We would like to see something that would be representative of the city," he said.
"I'm not sure that it is the right place for a cultural thing, but we also don't want to see a supermarket or block of flats there."

===Input Doc/Src: The government originally owned a 41% stake after ploughing £20bn into the bank during the 2008 financial crisis.
It started selling Lloyds shares in 2013, and the latest sale means it has now raised more than £8bn.
Last weekend, David Cameron said the Conservatives would offer up to £4bn of Lloyds shares to private investors if he won the general election.
The prime minister said it would "help us recover billions more to pay down the national debt". The Labour party said the Tories had announced the plans several times before.
In the latest sale, the government sold 742 million shares which, at Thursday's closing price, would have raised £586m for the Treasury. The actual total may be slightly lower as the government would have sold its shares throughout the day, during which Lloyds shares rose steadily in the afternoon to hit a closing high of 78.99 pence.
The sale means the government's shareholding has been reduced by another 1%, and is now down to 20.95%.
"Today's announcement shows the further progress made in returning Lloyds Banking Group to full private ownership and enabling the taxpayer to get their money back," a statement from Lloyds said.
"This reflects the hard work undertaken over the last four years to transform the group into a simple, low-risk and customer-focused bank that is committed to helping Britain prosper."

===Input Doc/Src: Archaeologists made the discovery at Tresness in Sanday while on a walk in poor weather on Monday.
The remains of 14 houses and stone tools, including knives, have been described as "one of the biggest complexes of Bronze Age settlement in the Scottish isles".
The finds on the beach could be more than 4,000 years old.
Archaeologists believe the houses were buried by sand dunes in the second millennium BC - but have recently been exposed by the actions of weather and the sea.
Prof Jane Downes and Christopher Gee, of the University of the Highlands and Islands, Prof Colin Richards, of the University of Manchester and Dr Vicki Cummings, of University of Central Lancashire, made the discovery.
They were on a sea shore walk to visit a known archaeological site when they spotted the remains of the houses and stone tools.
Prof Downes, who specialises in the Bronze Age, said: "This must be one of the biggest complexes of Bronze Age settlement in the Scottish isles, rivalling the spreads of hut circles in other parts of mainland Scotland."
The scale of the Sanday has been described as "unparalleled in Orkney". The islands are well-known for the Skara Brae Neolithic settlement.
Cath Parker, leader of the Sanday Archaeology Group, said: "This is incredibly exciting.
"The archaeological landscape concealed beneath Sanday's  shifting sands never ceases to amaze us.
"I'm sure the local community will relish the opportunity to be involved with any work which stems from this thrilling discovery."
Important Bronze Age discoveries have been made in recent years in other parts of Scotland.
Skeletal remains found at Drumnadrochit on the shores of Loch Ness were identified in February as dating back to the Early Bronze Age.
A wrist guard, for use with a bow and arrow, and shards of pottery were among remains found in a burial cist that was uncovered during work to build a new health centre.
Evidence of Bronze and Iron Age settlements were found at the site of the new Inverness Campus. T

Court papers said he had been on suicide watch at a detention centre.
Mr Sandford's mother Lynne, who was not in court for the hearing, wants him to return to the UK for psychiatric help.
Prosecutors allege Mr Sandford, 20, tried to grab a police officer's gun to shoot Republican presidential candidate Mr Trump at a campaign rally in Las Vegas on 18 June.
They also claim he practiced shooting at a gun range the previous day.
His trial has been scheduled for 3 October.
The Associated Press news agency said the meeting was also expected to include Ms Weksler and Ms Sandford's London lawyer Saimo Chahal.
US magistrate judge Cam Ferenbach said the meeting "might help in the resolution of the case in a way that benefits the defendant and the government", the agency reported.
Ms Sandford has said her son has autism, OCD, severe depression and would face up to 30 years in prison in the US.

===Input Doc/Src: Campaigners say the agreement is biased against the UK and is being used for offences it was not intended to cover.
The year-long review will also consider the breadth of the home secretary's discretion to intervene in cases.
It follows a series of high-profile cases, including that of computer hacker Gary McKinnon.
The Home Office says the current extradition arrangements will continue and the review will not impact on any cases currently under consideration.
The review panel, led by a retired Law Lord, is expected to be finished by the end of summer 2011.
Former Home Secretary David Blunkett, who signed the treaty, accused the current Home Secretary Theresa May of kicking the controversy "into the long grass".
Recently, he admitted he might have "given too much away" to the Americans and said sensible discussions with the UK's partners could resolve "any irritants quite speedily".
The review will consider the operation of the Extradition Act 2003, including the European arrest warrant, and the US/UK extradition treaty.
Home Secretary Theresa May said: "I am fully aware there are a number of areas of the UK's extradition arrangements which have attracted controversy in recent years.
"This government is committed to reviewing those arrangements to ensure they work both efficiently and in the interests of justice."
The European arrest warrant fast-tracks extradition between EU member states.
It means countries can ask for extradition of an individual without providing prima-facie evidence to the courts, usually as long as the offence is a crime in both countries and carries a prison sentence of more than one year.
Jago Russell, Fair Trials International's chief executive, said more than one thousand people were detained and extradited by the UK in the year 2009-2010 "under Europe's no-questions-asked extradition system".

Officials says more than 1.4 million people urgently need humanitarian help.
There are also fears of a cholera outbreak, with spikes in cases and deaths reported in the south west.
The waterborne disease reached the island via Nepalese UN troops after the deadly earthquake in 2010, causing the deaths of nearly 10,000 people.
Tensions have been high as help has yet to reach many families whose crops and water supplies have been destroyed.
Haitian police and UN peacekeepers used tear gas to disperse a group of 100 residents who attacked humanitarian convoys in Les Cayes on Saturday.
"We understand the impatience and the anger of the population who are waiting for emergency relief. We are doing all we can to facilitate the arrival of the assistance soon as possible," Mr Ban said.
He flew over areas hit by the hurricane alongside Prime Minister Enex Jean-Charles.
"I was very, very sad when we saw the complete devastation. But people the world over stand with you," the UN chief added.
"We are going to mobilize as many resources and as much medical support as we can to first of all stop the cholera epidemic and second support the families of the victims."
Some 120,000 homes were either damaged or destroyed when Category Four Hurricane Matthew swept through on 4 October with winds of 145mph (230km/h).
Mr Ban visited a shelter in Les Cayes and told the displaced "kembe fem" in Creole, meaning "hang in there".
In the town, one of the worst affected by Matthew, the streets have been cleaned and business have reopened.
But power, transport and communications links are still difficult in other areas.

===Input Doc/Src: That was better than the 3% pace that economists had been expecting and follows the 4.6% growth rate recorded in the April-June quarter.
Strong export growth and higher government spending helped to boost growth in the third quarter.
In a sign of confidence in the US recovery, on Wednesday the Federal Reserve ended its stimulus scheme.
The fall in the unemployment rate to a six-year low has helped to boost that confidence.
"Today's number represents a return to a healthy-looking trend. The most recent IMF forecasts suggest the US economy will grow 3.1% next year and 3.0% in 2016, and these could be revised further upwards in the coming months," said Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown stockbrokers.
The report was the first of three estimates of gross domestic product, so the figure could be revised up or down, over the coming months.
Growth was lifted in the third quarter by a sharp increase in government spending, which itself was boosted by a surge in defence expenditure.
Exports were another area of strength, they rose at an annual rate of 7.8%.
But there will be a question over whether that pace can be maintained as important export markets for the US are struggling.
Growth in many European countries is stagnant and the Chinese economy is slowing down.
Consumption growth was relatively weak in the third quarter, running at an annual rate of 1.8%, but economists expect that to improve.
"Conditions are in place for a pick-up in the pace of consumption growth," said Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics.
"Real personal disposable incomes increased by a healthy 2.7% in the third quarter and, with the prospect of further big gains in employment and the impact of the slump in energy prices, real incomes should enjoy an even bigger gain in the fourth quarter."
Overall it has been a volatile year for US growth data.

"Our Keep it Clean campaign promotes good biosecurity practice and explains that it only takes a few minutes to brush off any mud or forest debris from boots, walking poles or bike tyres.

"It is the most special thing I have, beyond all trophies," said Hamilton.
"As I kid I thought maybe one day I can get to Formula 1 and emulate Ayrton. To equal him; I just can't believe it."
Hamilton has long since surpassed Senna's record of 41 wins - he did so at the 2015 Japanese Grand Prix - and now has 55.
In both poles and wins, he now lags behind only seven-time champion Michael Schumacher, who claimed 68 poles and 91 victories.
Asked whether surpassing Senna's marks meant more than Schumacher's, Hamilton said: "I haven't got to the 68 of Michael so I can't really say. I can't look that far ahead at the moment.
"Ayrton was the guy I noticed from the beginning. I think it was the colour of the helmet. So I am honoured to be honoured by that family.
"To think that I am that close to Michael's record is incredible - I plan on getting there but that is all ifs and buts."
Hamilton, who repeatedly looked at Senna's helmet as he sat in the post-qualifying news conference, said the achievement was even more special given it happened at one of his favourite races - where he claimed his first pole and win back in his debut season of 2007.
"I knew 65 was there and waiting; I knew Montreal has been a beautiful place for me," he said. "I thought if I was going to get that special pole anywhere, it was going to be here.

===Input Doc/Src: The bond, which will pay a fixed gross rate of interest of 6.50% a year until 2022, was on sale from 24 April to 6 May.
David Armstrong, the club's chief executive, said the response had been "very positive" and offered stability for the club's future.
Wasps play in the Aviva Premiership at the Ricoh Arena in Coventry.
The club moved to the 32,600-seater stadium from Adams Park, High Wycombe, in December 2014.
"The funds raised [from bond sales] will enable us to restructure our balance sheet and pay down our existing debt, including the loans we acquired with the Ricoh Arena," Mr Armstrong said.
"We now have a solid foundation for the long-term future of the club and look forward to the future with confidence."
Minimum initial investment in the bond was £2,000 - which, like any investment, has risks involved. There are plans for it to be tradable on the London Stock Exchange's Order Book for Retail Bonds.
The bonds will be guaranteed by the two key operating companies, Wasps Holdings and Arena Coventry Ltd, including the Ricoh Arena.
Interest will be paid on 13 November and 13 May in each year with the investment due to be paid back in full on 13 May, 2022. Trading in the bonds is earmarked to start on 14 May.

===Input Doc/Src: Neville, a former Manchester United and Everton player, was criticised for his lack of emotion and "monotone" style.
In response, Neville told BBC Radio 5 live the TV role was "a lot harder than I thought it was going to be".
Despite the complaints, the BBC said the footballer would continue to play "a key role throughout the tournament".
A spokesperson added Neville - who is currently a coach for Manchester United and has received broadcast training - was "an important, well-respected member of our team".
Neville told sports presenter Mark Chapman he welcomed the feedback on his performance: "In terms of the content I got out, I thought [it] was quite good.
"But the feedback is that I need to show a bit more excitement, so I think you'll see that more on Thursday night in the highlights show.
"I will get better - it was my first live gig and I'm just glad I helped everyone get to sleep back home!"
The England v Italy match attracted an average 11.5 million viewers, peaking at 15.6 million just before half-time making it one of the most watched programmes of the year so far.
Viewers also took to Twitter to criticise Neville, with several joking England physio Gary Lewin - who was stretchered off after injuring his ankle - had "fallen into a coma" listening to him.
Neville responded saying: "1st live co-comm last night - sometimes u have to take the criticism - it will only make me better- thanks for the feedback (ahhahaha)!"
BBC Radio 5 live broadcaster Danny Baker was among his critics but said the BBC should share the blame.
"Phil Neville has acknowledged he wasn't great during England commentary - but what were the BBC doing giving him that game to 'learn his craft'?" he said.
Neville's next World Cup appearance is as a BBC TV studio guest for Monday night's game between Iran and Nigeria.
The complaints come four months after more than 300 people complained over the corporation's quality of commentary during a snowboarding final at the Winter Olympics.

===Input Doc/Src: Tourist attractions and community groups are among those to benefit from the funding.
The Shakespeare Birthplace Trust has been granted £880,000, which bosses say will be used to reach wider audiences.
Birmingham-based One Dance UK will receive the highest investment of £3m, while British Ceramics Biennial in Stoke-on-Trent will receive £700,000.
In a move to fund more regional organisations, 25 new groups will receive funding between 2018 and 2022.
Some organisations have faced cuts to their funding but none have lost out completely.
The Royal Shakespeare Company has lost 3% of their previous investment but will still be granted just under £60m.
The Arts Council said in a statement it is pleased to be investing in projects that "will benefit local people".
The region will see an overall increase in spending of 8% with the annual sum paid to arts organisations rising from £49.6m to £53.5m.
The Lapworth Museum in Birmingham is one of the new organisations to benefit and has been granted £418, 984.
Director Jon Clatworthy said it's been a "fantastic year" for the museum which has just celebrated one year since its reopening as well as a nomination for Museum of the Year.
The geology museum will be using the investment to diversify its audience and develop digital technology in exhibitions.
The Shakespeare Birthplace Trust in Stratford-Upon-Avon is another receiving Arts Council funding for the first time.
Chief executive Diana Owen says the Trust will spend the money "directly on activities to reach out to more people than ever before".
Peter Knott, area director for Arts Council England said: "The Midlands already boasts a vibrant cultural scene with an international reputation for excellence and we look forward to seeing more great art and culture being enjoyed by more audiences in more places.
"Arts and culture plays a vital role in making the area a great place to live, work and study and we're pleased to be investing in projects which will benefit local people an

===Input Doc/Src: A new report said the gap between the hourly earnings of the two sexes widens after women become mothers.
Their hourly pay rate falls 33% behind men's over a 12-year period, it added.
But in Northern Ireland, there is an established trend of women earning more than men.
In 2010, typical (median) female full-time hourly earnings, excluding overtime, in Northern Ireland moved slightly ahead of male earnings for the first time.
That has continued over the last five years, except for 2012 when typical female and male full-time hourly earnings were the same.
In 2015, typical female full-time hourly earnings, excluding overtime, were 101% of male earnings compared to a ratio of 91% for the UK as a whole.
The pattern of women earning slightly more than men is not uniform across the income distribution.
Men have higher earnings in the 90th percentile (among the top 10% of earners), and at the 40th percentile and below.
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has suggested that the gap in favour of full-time female workers overall is partly to do with a higher proportion of public sector jobs in Northern Ireland than in the rest of the UK.
There are more women employed in this sector than men and these jobs tend to be higher paid, in general, than in the private sector.
At a wider, all-employee level, there is still a gap in favour of men because there are more full-time male employees.
All of the above data is from the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings.
---Sum/Tgt: Full-time female workers in Northern Ireland are defying the gender pay gap to earn more than their male counterparts, official figures have shown.

===Input Doc/Src: The Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead is one of the first councils in England to launch a PledgeBank.
The pledges, from cleaning graffiti to organising a street party, can only be undertaken if other residents commit to the idea.
The Conservative council said the scheme helps it save money but also "results in a better social outcome".
Once a pledge is made, the council will check it fits the set criteria and then publish it online.
It comes after a failed Big Society scheme to get residents to donate savings in their council tax, which the council has cut for the past four years.
George Bathurst, cabinet member for policy and performance, said other schemes such as Green Redeem recycling rewards were a success.
He said: "No one wants to just hand over a cheque but everybody would like to do something for their community."
Mr Bathurst will make the first pledge to donate five Christmas food items to FoodBank if 10 other local people will do the same by 18 December.
Fiona Dent, Windsor's Labour candidate, said: "Volunteering creates strong bonds between people, reinforces their ideals and can provide the help people need in difficult times.
"However, we are living through difficult times now. Most people in the middle and lower incomes are a lot worse off than they were five years ago and they may well have more than one job to help pay the bills, leaving less time for volunteer activities."

The number of walkers climbing Snowdon has doubled since 2007 and more than four million people visited Snowdonia last year.
But the trust said grass species move in when pathways are eroded, strangling some plants.
Rhys Thomas, National Trust ranger for Snowdonia, said: "I've been building and rebuilding paths in the area for eight years.
"It's tiring, time-consuming and back-breaking work - involving hundreds of hours of volunteer time which requires shifting tonnes of stone by hand, vehicle and helicopter.
"But it's vital if we want to protect the delicate upland habitats that make Snowdonia a special place for wildlife."
Plants which could be at risk include purple saxifrage, moss campion and roseroot.
It is also home to the endangered Snowdon beetle - which in the UK are only found in Snowdonia.
The trust is trying to raise Â£250,000 to repair two-and-a-half miles of path.
It comes as concerns grow over the amount of litter being left on Snowdon, with some calling for a walker's charge to be introduced.
The appeal is supported by Hollywood actor Matthew Rhys, National Trust Wales's Snowdonia Ambassador.
Mr Rhys, who is from Cardiff, but has strong family connections to the national park, said he had seen the "trail of destruction left by the eroded paths" during visits to the area.
"There's a delicate balance to be struck between man and nature," he added.
National Trust Wales looks after almost 58,000 acres of mountain and farmland across the Snowdonia National Park.

A Twitter campaign - #Get1DToLeah - called for the pop band to contact her.
Friends said Ms Washington would be "elated" at the news.
Sara Stuart, who helped start the campaign, said she had been to the Royal Stoke Hospital to visit the teenager, whom she described as a huge fan of the band.
"She's seen them so many times," Ms Stuart said.
"It's really given Leah something to aim for and really look forward to once she's recovered."
The campaign has received thousands of retweets.
"The support has been overwhelming. It made me so happy that so many people were supporting one of my closest friends."
She said the message "would make Leah's day and aid her recovery".
She added her friend had tickets to see the band in concert in Cardiff on Saturday but was unable to go because of her injuries.
The band are currently in Europe as part of a world tour.
"After visiting her yesterday and knowing how upset she was that she missed seeing them on Saturday, we decided we would try and get in touch with them to see if they were prepared to visit her or send her a video message," she said.
"She would love this."
The band's agents said the band's four members - Niall Horan, Liam Payne, Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson - had filmed a video message for Ms Washington.
"Unfortunately because of their schedule they can't visit her in hospital, but they have offered Leah tickets to a forthcoming concert of her choice when she has recovered, and will be delighted to meet her backstage then," they said.

The Department for Transport (DfT) said the process of awarding a contract beyond then had not begun.
In March London Midland announced it would shed 150 jobs, while in November it said driver shortages had led to cancelled or delayed services.
Figures showed about 20% of its 1,311 daily services were delayed or cancelled throughout October.

A DfT spokesman said during the extra six months it would be "working closely with the company to ensure they continue to improve the service they provide to passengers".
The process had not yet started of awarding a so-called management contract to run from March 2016 to June 2017, the department said.

===Input Doc/Src: Thomas Condliff, who weighs 22 stone (140kg) and has type 2 diabetes, is challenging a decision to refuse him a gastric bypass operation.
NHS North Staffordshire says he does not meet its criteria for weight loss surgery.
Decisions about exceptional funding are based on medical factors alone.
Mr Condliff, 62, was initially refused funding for a gastric bypass operation because his weight/height ratio (Body Mass Index) fell below the threshold set by his local primary care trust.
At 22 stone his Body Mass Index (BMI) is about 43, but in North Staffordshire only patients with a BMI over 50 are routinely treated with weight loss surgery.  A decision to refuse him funding as an exceptional case was upheld in an earlier court hearing.
Now Mr Condliff is taking his legal battle to the Court of Appeal in a case that has implications for many other areas.
NHS North Staffordshire makes its decisions for exceptional funding on the medical condition of the patient, and rules out considering their personal circumstances.
As a result of his diabetes Tom Condliff has lost the sight in one eye, and he also has kidney problems. He can no longer stand or walk for more than a short time and relies on his wife, Lana, to help him wash and dress.
He says that during his legal battle his quality of life has worsened, and even an extremely calorie-restricted diet has failed to help him lose weight.
"I've been given about a year to live by one of the specialists. I feel more and more poorly each day, my diabetes is way out of control."
Having failed to overturn the initial decision to refuse a gastric bypass, he is now resting his hopes on asking the courts to compel the NHS to take into account the impact on his life and that of his family.
"My wife barely goes out, because she doesn't want to leave me. It's awful just being locked indoors. It doesn't matter where you live, how nice it is, it's still a cage. "
In the two-day hearing, the Court of Appeal will hear evidence from both sides

===Input Doc/Src: Second-placed Chelsea closed the gap back to 10 points with a 4-0 thrashing of Birmingham City Ladies.
City dominated a scoreless first half against Reading but had to wait until Beattie's second-half header to lead.
Houghton's classy late free-kick found the bottom corner to make it 2-0.
The victory was well deserved but the visitors restricted City's opportunities in the first period, with Jane Ross going closest when her shot hit the bar.
However, Beattie eased any fears of dropping points when she converted Toni Duggan's free-kick soon after the restart, and fellow centre-back Houghton wrapped up victory with two minutes remaining.
City have three league matches left, including one against Chelsea. Even if they lose to the London side, City need only two wins to be certain of clinching the league title.
Manchester City defender Jennifer Beattie:
"I know the feeling of having won the league and I want that to happen with this club. It's a brilliant club and we want titles, and we want silverware. Hopefully experience will help.
"The best thing is that we're still not happy; we still think we can get better.
"We've scored twice from set pieces but we want to be scoring from open play too. We've got the quality there but it's just about making it happen in the final third."
Reading defender Molly Bartrip:
"It's difficult to be sat back in your own half, but you come away to teams like Manchester City and you expect that.
"We knew what we had to do to stop them getting through us. We executed it really well, it was just two silly set pieces.
"I think if you look at both games between the two teams, we have matched them both times. It's little mistakes that are costing us the game."

===Input Doc/Src: State-funded Holyport College near Maidenhead, opened to pupils for the first time in September.
The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were given a tour of the school before unveiling a plaque watched by its 122 pupils, staff and parents.
Holyport College, sponsored by Eton College, accepts boarders and gives its pupils access to some of Eton's facilities.
During the visit, the royal couple met Sir Nicholas Winton, who lives near the school which has named its reception building after him.
Sir Nicholas, dubbed the "British Schindler", helped to save hundreds of children, mainly from Jewish families, from the Nazis by transporting them by train from Prague to the UK in 1939.
The wheelchair-bound 105-year-old said: "I think it's a wonderful honour to have the building named after me.
"I hope the school will make contact with a school in the Czech Republic that is also named after me."
Other guests included Home Secretary Theresa May, MP for Maidenhead.
The school was proposed in February 2012 and then approved by the Department for Education through the free schools programme in June 2012.
Once it reaches capacity, the school will have 500 pupils, including 225 boarders aged 11-19 years.
Parents pay £3,850 a term for boarders but daytime education is free.
Free schools, which anyone can apply to set up, are funded directly by central government and are free from local council control.

===Input Doc/Src: It looked at progress in England following the introduction of a £5.3bn Better Care Fund to help local authorities invest in services to keep patients out of hospital.
It says in its first year, the fund has helped join up health and social care.
But it hasn't led to the expected reduction in hospital workload.
The Department of Health said it was too soon to judge the Fund's impact.
According to the NAO, within the first year of the Better Care Fund being introduced:
A week of coverage by BBC News examining the state of the NHS across the UK as it comes under intense pressure during its busiest time of the year.
The total Better Care Fund budget for 2015-16 was £5.3bn (some local authorities added extra money to the £3.8bn earmarked by the government).
It was hoped the Fund would return a saving of around £500m in its first year by reducing demand for costly hospital care.
Using the Fund, local authorities had estimated they could cut emergency hospital admissions by 106,000. Instead, they went up by 87,000, compared to the previous year.
The number of delayed transfers of care cases - when a patient is healthy enough to leave the hospital but is unable to do so - was meant to drop by 293,000. It went up by 185,000.
The NAO report says cash flow worries are mounting in both health and social care and it remains unclear whether more integration of services will help.
It says the government should take stock and evaluate how best to move forward.
The Department of Health says it wants to make care even more joined-up.
Sir Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office, said: "Integrating the health and social care sectors is a significant challenge in normal times, let alone times when both sectors are under such severe pressure. So far, benefits have fallen far short of plans, despite much effort."

SpaceX said "an anomaly" had occurred while the rocket was being loaded with fuel. No-one was injured, it said.
The rocket's payload, an  Israeli-built communications satellite for Facebook due to launch on Saturday, was also destroyed, it added.
Facebook, in partnership with Eutelsat Communications, had been due to use the Amos-6 satellite to deliver broadband internet coverage for swathes of sub-Saharan Africa as part of its Internet.org initiative.

===Input Doc/Src: The senior brother had previously been moved out of Rubane House, where he abused young boys, and became principal of a school in Downpatrick.
The details were revealed at the Historical Institutional Abuse (HIA) Inquiry.
It is examining allegations of abuse at Rubane House in Kircubbin.
About 200 former residents have made allegations of abuse.
The inquiry also heard the De La Salle Religious Order paid compensation to victims who were sexually abused at Rubane House within years of the order ruling that a previous investigation into their abuser was "best forgotten".
The HIA has been told that one victim, then aged 12, arrived at Rubane House in 1961.
Three years earlier, in 1958, the order launched an internal inquiry into claims of sex abuse against the brother in charge of the home.
The order subsequently ruled that "no reference is to be made at any time or to anyone regarding the inquiry".
However, the senior brother continued to sexually abuse boys at the home. The order later paid the victim £27,500 in compensation.
Another victim, who was in the home from 1958 to 1960, was paid £20,000 in compensation earlier this year.
Junior counsel to the inquiry, Joseph Aiken, opted not to read out the contents of a statement the man made to police in 2010.
Mr Aiken invited the inquiry panel to adjourn to take time to read the statement which he described as "graphic".
The inquiry also heard the victim "subsequently abused his own children".
Rubane House was open from 1950 to 1985.
A total of 55 former residents have come forward to the inquiry to allege that they were physically or sexually abused.
The sex abuse allegations at Rubane House ranged from watching children in the shower to rape, while physical abuse ranged from corporal punishment to serious assault.

===Input Doc/Src: Parents are only allowed to take children out of school in "exceptional circumstances" or face fines.
Bishop Bronescombe C of E School in St Austell, Cornwall, is creating the extra week at the end of the May half-term holiday.
Cornwall Council said it was up to schools to plan their inset days.
Changes to the law, which came into force on 1 September, mean head teachers no longer have the discretion to grant authorised leave to pupils each year.
The new rules are aimed at preventing children missing vital parts of their education, which the the Department for Education (DfE) said can have a "hugely damaging effect".
But some parents have said they cannot afford to pay the premium prices travel companies charge during official school holidays.
The head of school at Bishop Bronescombe, Katie Dalton, said it would be putting the five teacher training days together in the summer term.
"Lots of our parents are low wage earners, which is typical in Cornwall, and also they are seasonal workers, which makes it very difficult for them to get a family holiday together, that is actually affordable.
"By putting the inset days all together in the summer term, it means they can take advantage of better deals and prices and it improves our attendance figures as well because there are less requests for leave during term time," she said.
Deborah Smith, who has two children at the school, welcomed the move.
"They said they understood lots of the parents down here are seasonal workers and they understand about the current economical climate and that budgets are tight for families, so I thought that was really important that the school were acknowledging and recognising the difficulty of paying for holidays," she said.
In a statement the DfE said: "Poor attendance at school can have a hugely damaging effect, and children who attend school regularly are nearly four times more likely to achieve five or more good GCSEs than those who are regularly absent.
"That is why we have given schoo

Barnsley manager Danny Wilson said he did not believe the 22-year-old would struggle to adapt to English football.
"He has got good pace and is a very good finisher as the stats will tell you," said Wilson.
"He can play in a number of positions, but more importantly he's down the middle and has got goals in him, which is what we want to bring into the team."
Hemmings began his career at Tamworth before moving to Rangers, for whom he made 10 appearances, and then joined Cowdenbeath in the summer of 2013 after a successful loan spell.
He is Barnsley's second signing since being relegated from the Championship, following the arrival of ex-Sheffield Wednesday goalkeeper Adam Davies.

===Input Doc/Src: South and West Yorkshire would both control some tax and spending if local councils devolve powers to new combined authorities run by a mayor.
Under the proposals, strategic planning, transport and economic regeneration powers would be handed over.
The Chancellor, George Osborne, could announce the plan on Wednesday.
The five West Yorkshire councils - Bradford, Calderdale, Kirklees, Leeds and Wakefield - joined the neighbouring City of York in North Yorkshire to form a combined authority six months ago.
Barnsley, Doncaster, Rotherham and Sheffield councils have created a similar South Yorkshire body.
The existing councils would continue to run services such as education and waste management individually.
Under the current agreement one of the council leaders is chosen by the others to chair the combined authority.
The chancellor's idea takes this on much further with extra powers for the combined authority to control social welfare policy, raise tax and control public spending. In return leadership would be given to a new generation of "metro mayors" wielding considerable executive powers.
Councillor Peter Box, Labour leader of Wakefield City Council and current chair of the West Yorkshire Combined Authority, said he would welcome any extra power and budgets but totally reject a regional executive mayor.
Wakefield, Bradford, Leeds and Sheffield all rejected individual city mayors in referendums just two years ago.
"Just a couple of weeks ago the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg was in Leeds and told us that we could have the devolved powers without having to accept an executive mayor," said Mr Box.
"Go on any street and it becomes clear the public will simply not accept another elected politician."
Andrew Carter, leader of the opposition Conservative Group on Leeds City Council, voted against creating a local executive mayor in the 2012 referendums.
"But, a metro mayor is a completely different proposition," he said.

All 151 passengers were evacuated and flights were suspended for three hours.
A backpack belonging to the men was blown up by police.
A spokesman for Cologne-Bonn airport confirmed the landing, adding: "Prior to this, the pilot had been informed about a suspicious conversation on board, after which he decided to make an unscheduled landing in Cologne-Bonn.
"After the safe landing... the 151 passengers left the [aircraft] via emergency slides and were taken to a transit gate."
The passengers had to "undergo a check immediately" and additional security checks were carried out on the plane.
A statement from Cologne police said other passengers had made the crew aware of a conversation by three men.
It said the subject had been "terrorist content", without elaborating further.
It added that federal police had "blown up in a controlled manner" a backpack belonging to the men.
Easyjet said the captain had taken the decision to land as a precaution to allow additional security checks to take place.
All the passengers had been given a hotel for the night and would be flown back on Sunday morning, she said.
"We thank passengers for their understanding. The safety of Easyjet's passengers and crew is our highest priority."

===Input Doc/Src: But Mr Obama said those who looted and started fires on Monday "should be treated like criminals".
The rioting came after the funeral of Freddie Gray, a black man fatally injured in police custody in Baltimore.
A week-long curfew has been announced and thousands of troops have been deployed to the city.
The National Guard has been sent to Baltimore to stop unrest for the first time since 1968, when some of the city's neighbourhoods went up in flames after the assassination of the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr.
On Tuesday evening, hundreds of protesters took to the streets to express their frustration with what they see as excessive police force.
The peaceful demonstrations were a contrast to the day before, when about 200 people were arrested as more than 100 cars were set alight and 15 buildings destroyed.
Mr Obama harshly criticised "a handful of people" for "senseless violence and destruction".
"That is not a protest, that is not a statement, they are stealing."
But the US president said the rioting had distracted from the frustration over Gray's death.
"This has been a slow-rolling crisis. This has been going on for a long time. This is not new. And we shouldn't pretend that it's new," Mr Obama said.
He added such problems would not be solved just by changes to policing.
"It would require everybody saying this is important, this is significant, and that we don't just pay attention to these communities when a CVS burns and we don't just pay attention when a young man gets shot or has his spine snapped."
At an afternoon briefing, Baltimore Captain Eric Kowalczyk was asked why the police had not responded with more resources to prevent fires and rioting.
He said police had originally deployed for a "high school event", expecting young students.
"I don't think there's anyone in the country that would expect us to deploy automatic weapons and armoured vehicles to an event with 13, 14 and 15 year olds," but saw it turned into an incident that drew in older troublemak

===Input Doc/Src: "We are asking people to move to safer areas," a spokeswoman for the national relief agency said.
The south and centre have been placed on red alert because of the floods, which have claimed several lives.
In 2000, 700 people died and half a million were made homeless in Mozambique's worst flooding on record.
The worst affected areas are in the southern Gaza province, where a number of rivers are currently above crisis levels.
Emergency teams are on stand-by and motorboats have been dispatched to help transport people to safety, the AFP news agency reports. The evacuees will be brought to temporary shelters. Some of them have been set up in the capital, Maputo.
"We estimate there are 55,000 people affected," Rita Almeida from Mozambique's Disaster Relief Management Institute told AFP.
The town of Chokwe, home to a dyke, is particularly vulnerable, she added.
"We are registering very high water levels in the Limpopo and Inkomati rivers that could flood the town," Ms Almeida said.
From Sunday to Monday, almost 185mm (7 inches) of rain fell over the Limpopo basin, the AFP reports.
International observers have described the situation as critical. There are fears that the dyke in Chokwe could break, which would lead to chaos in the evacuations.
"If that dyke breaks, all those people will have to move more rapidly," the country chief of the World Food Programme, Lola Castro, said.
Neighbouring South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana have also been hit by severe flooding.
In South Africa, floodwaters claimed several lives and left hundreds stranded after the Limpopo river burst its banks on Monday.

===Input Doc/Src: Health Minister Recep Akdag was quoted by the Anadolu news agency as saying traces of one of the decomposition products of Sarin had been detected in the blood and urine of several victims.
At least 89 people were killed in the incident in rebel-held Khan Sheikhoun.
Syria's government has repeatedly denied using any chemical weapons.
The US has rejected the assertion, however, and on Friday it carried out a missile strike on the Shayrat airbase, where it said a Syrian Air Force jet that attacked Khan Sheikhoun with chemical weapons took off.
President Bashar al-Assad's ally Russia, which says the Syrian jet had in fact hit a rebel depot full of chemical munitions, denounced the "illegal action" by the US.
A number of casualties were treated at hospitals in Turkey, which opposes Mr Assad, following last Tuesday's incident in neighbouring Idlib province.
The World Health Organization said their apparent lack of external injuries and similar symptoms, including acute respiratory distress, suggested they had been exposed to organophosphorus chemicals, a category that includes nerve agents.
On Tuesday, Mr Akdag announced that a chemical known as isopropyl methyphosphonic acid (IMPA) had been "identified in the blood and urine tests conducted on samples taken from the victims".
Once exposed to air and water, Sarin breaks down into IMPA and methylphosphonic acid (MPA).
The UN concluded that rockets filled with sarin were fired at several rebel-held suburbs of Damascus in August 2013 after finding traces of IMPA in samples taken from the scene of the attack, which the US blamed on Syria's government.
Earlier on Thursday, Russia's president urged the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to open a full investigation into last week's incident.

Mendes directed 2012's Skyfall and the forthcoming Bond film, titled Spectre.
"I don't think I could go down that road again," he said. "You do have to put everything else on hold."
Spectre, in which Daniel Craig will make his fourth appearance as the MI6 agent, will come out on 26 October in the UK and 6 November in the US.
Spectre and Skyfall took a total of five years to make, he told BBC Radio's Test Match Special.
"It feels almost, even though we've just finished shooting it, like one big experience and it was a fantastic life-changing thing," he said. But he added he did not think he could go through it again.
"It really is more a lifestyle choice than a job," he said.
Mendes made his name in theatre, and directed a new stage production of Roald Dahl's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory in between making the Bond films.
But shooting a Bond movie is "pretty much all encompassing", he explained.
"I'm happiest rehearsing a play or editing a movie, and when I've finished editing a movie I generally want to be back in a theatre environment again," he said.
"It feels like home, it feels controllable after the chaos of a movie set. But it won't be long before I want to do another film, and I'm very fortunate to be able to go back and forth between the two."
Spectre has been filmed in locations including London, Mexico, Italy and Morocco, and the cast and crew totalled more than 1,000 people, Mendes revealed.
"And you really do feel it," he said. "This is a bigger movie than Skyfall. It's shot in more places - we were in Mexico City and Tangiers and northern Sahara and Rome and the Alps and London. It's been an enormous undertaking."

Drugs tests carried out on a substance found around some of the UN vehicles were negative, the police said.
The vehicles were allowed to be reloaded on board before the ship left, but the police have retained the arms.
The rifles and rocket-propelled grenades, which were among the weapons found inside the UN vehicles, would be delivered under Kenyan escort to Indian peacekeepers in DR Congo, Mombasa County police commander Francis Wanjohi said.
He said it would be too dangerous for the MV Hoegh Transporter to continue its journey if it was common knowledge there were weapons aboard, because of the threat of piracy.
The ship had been sailing from Mumbai in India, but its final destination is unknown.
The BBC's Ferdinand Omondi in Mombasa says the dramatic midnight raid on the vessel after it had docked on Thursday night involved several elite Kenya police units, including the narcotics squad and the criminal investigation department.
The whole port was shut down and people asked to leave as it searched the ship, he says.
The UN's Nairobi office said the misunderstanding over the weapons, often stored in vehicles for to avoid damage in transit, was down to a clerical error.
It said although the weapons were not declared in the manifest, a separate declaration accompanying the military vehicles was attached.
A UN spokesman further explained new vehicles often had anti-humidity powder put around tyres for long shipments.
Hoegh Autoliners, the owners of the ship, were contemplating suing the state for damages and defamation, a lawyer representing them in Kenya, said.

But his agent said Crawford retired after missing out on London 2012.
Crawford failed to qualify for last year's Olympics after finishing seventh in the US trials final.
"He's 35 years of age, and has moved on," his representative Kimberly Holland told Reuters.  "Unfortunately, his announcement wasn't enough, as he had to complete retirement paper work to be removed from the testing pool."
Crawford also won silver in the 200m and the 4x100m relay at the Beijing Olympics.
When Usain Bolt won the first of his Olympic 200m titles in 2008, Crawford originally finished fourth, but was given the silver medal after Wallace Spearmon and Churandy Martina of Netherlands Antilles were disqualified for running out of their lanes.
Crawford later gave his medal to Martina, who would have been the first Olympic medallist from his country.
In 2003, he took part in a US television programme that saw him race against a zebra and a giraffe. He beat the giraffe but lost twice to the zebra after demanding a rematch following a false start.

But since President Mohammed Morsi and his Muslim Brotherhood were removed from power by the military in early July, Islamist extremists have targeted Egypt's Christian minority, holding them partly responsible.
The Coptic Pope, Tawadros II, has received death threats, while several Christians have been killed.
At St Mark's Cathedral in Cairo on Sunday, dozens of children gathered for Bible study. Security at the gates was tight, after an attack there earlier this year.
Last Tuesday, 10-year-old Jessi Boulus was walking home from her Bible class in a working-class area of the capital when a gunman killed her with a single shot to the chest.
For Jessi's parents, the grief is still almost too raw for words. She was their only child. Both try but cannot hold back the tears as they describe their daughter.
Her mother, Phoebe, believes that she was targeted purely because she was Christian.

"She was my best friend, my everything. Jessi was just becoming a young woman," she says. "Every woman dreams of becoming a mother, and for 10 years I was lucky enough to be a mum. I'll miss Jessi calling me mum - I know I won't ever hear it again."
Jessi's father, Boulus, veers between grief and despair, as he recalls the hatred that changed their lives forever.
"Jessi was everything to us. Her killers didn't know that Jessi was my life - my future. They killed our future. I lived for her. We both did," he says, unable to conceal his emotion.
The couple say that in recent months, Jessi had begun to worry about her own safety, aware of the tensions on the streets. The family had talked about emigrating, but made a conscious decision to remain in Egypt, their home.

===Input Doc/Src: Enrique is leaving after three years in charge at the Nou Camp.
Ibai Gomez hit the post for Alaves before Messi scored his 54th goal of the season with a 20-yard curler.
Theo Hernandez bent in a free-kick to equalise, but Neymar turned in from close range and then Messi played in Paco Alcacer right on half-time.
It has been a disappointing season for Barcelona, who finished runners-up to Real Madrid in La Liga and were eliminated from the Champions League by Juventus in the quarter-finals.
They did at least restore some pride with victory over last season's second division champions in what was the final match to be played at Atletico Madrid's Vicente Calderon Stadium.
There were some records set along the way as Enrique's team retained the trophy, having beaten Athletic Bilbao and Sevilla in the last two finals.
Messi, who struck the opener after exchanging passes with Neymar outside the penalty area, became the first player to score in four Copa finals since Athletic Bilbao's Telmo Zarra in 1950.
Neymar, who forced in Barcelona's second when Messi played in Andre Gomes to cross low from the right, is the first man to score in three successive Copa finals since Ferenc Puskas, who achieved the feat with Real Madrid between 1960 and 1962.
Messi's through pass for the third goal was sublime, and was finished calmly by Alcacer - who has been inconsistent since his move from Valencia last summer.
The one major worry for Barcelona was a nasty head injury to Javier Mascherano, who was carried off on a stretcher after an early collision with Marcos Llorente,

The contract workers were on an anti-drug surveillance mission when their aircraft broke down in the Colombian jungle in February 2003.
They were eventually rescued by the Colombian military in 2008.
Hostages Thomas Howes, Keith Stansell and Marc Gonsalves were imprisoned by members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) and held by Herrera's unit for around two years.
While Alexander Beltran Herrera did not have much contact with the hostages, the court heard how the three men were taken deep into the jungle and kept in chains for much of the five years of their captivity.
Keith Stansell removed his shirt to show the court scars around his neck from the chains and described being chained to a tree whilst suffering from malaria.
But, addressing Herrera, he said: "I don't want him to suffer like we did."
Herrera was extradited to the United States in 2012.  His lawyer described him as a man of little education who had been trying to build a new life after he deserted from the Farc in 2009.
According to Associated Press, he apologised to the men during the trial, saying: "I feel shamed about what you all had to go through.''
Colombian military forces rescued the three Americans in July 2008 in a high profile helicopter rescue operation, which also brought about the release of French-Colombian politician Ingrid Betancourt, as well as 10 other hostages.
The Farc are currently engaged in dialogue with the Colombian authorities in a bid to negotiate a peace deal - some see it as the best chance for a negotiated settlement since the guerrilla group launched its armed struggle in 1964.

===Input Doc/Src: Glasgow City Council confirmed Harry Clarke had been suspended following evidence at the ongoing inquiry into the tragedy, which killed six people.
The inquiry has heard Mr Clarke, 58, previously fainted while working as a bus driver but failed to disclose the incident when he joined the council.
It has also heard a claim Mr Clarke "lied through his teeth" to doctors.
A spokesman for the council confirmed that it had suspended Mr Clarke on a precautionary basis pending a full disciplinary investigation.
He added: "A number of allegations have been made during the enquiry in regard to Mr Clarke's conduct before and at the point where he commenced employment with the council.
"These allegations have yet to be put to Mr Clarke and he has not yet had the opportunity of responding to them. The internal investigation will therefore take place at the conclusion of the fatal accident inquiry".
The fatal accident inquiry (FAI) at Glasgow Sheriff Court has previously heard evidence that Mr Clarke had suffered episodes of dizziness and fainting for decades before the fatal crash on 22 December, when several witnesses reported seeing him slumped behind the wheel on the bin lorry as it went out of control in the city centre.
But he failed to disclose his health history to the DVLA and on job application forms, and was said to have continued to deny any history of blackouts even after the bin lorry crash.
In April 2010 - shortly before he joined the council - Mr Clarke fainted on a stationary bus while working as a driver for First Bus.
The FAI has heard claims that Mr Clarke was "on his last legs" at the bus firm following repeated sick days prior to his blackout.
Paramedics examined him on the bus and he refused to accompany them to hospital, instead returning to the depot where he informed his managers about the blackout.
He visited Baillieston Health Centre and told his GP, Dr Gerard McKaig, that he fainted "at work, in canteen, hot environment, no warning signs".

===Input Doc/Src: The RT-branded box contains food packaged in laboratory bottles, such as Medonium honey - "med" being honey in Russian and Meldonium a performance-enhancing drugs taken by athletes.
There is also raspberry jam tagged "anabolic" in reference to steroids also banned in sports.
"Not everyone realised this was a humorous present from RT," the broadcaster said. It has consistently denied and ridiculed allegations of a state-sponsored doping programme in Russia.
One of the gift boxes was sent to Yulia Efimova, who won two swimming silver medals at the 2016 Rio Olympics.
A photo posted on Russia's leading social networking website VKontakte shows a smiling Efimova with test tubes and vials apparently containing food, such as jam, honey and condiments.
On its website, RT gave further details of its gift pack which it suggested had also been sent to other people.
The website carried a video from the Twitter account of blogger Evgeny Kozlov showing one of the kits being unpacked.
People from RT are "unbelievably creative", he said.
The kits also include cards said to be based on drawings by children from an orphanage.
"A New Year's card that you will never throw away," said Yulia Ostroukhova, apparently another recipient of the gift box.
"Very nice. Many thanks for the delicious Medonium, too," she said on Facebook.
It is not clear how many kits were produced or how many recipients there were.
In July, an investigation commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) said Russia's sports ministry "directed, controlled and oversaw" manipulation of urine samples provided by its athletes.
A number of Russian athletes were banned from competing at the Rio Olympics, but no blanket ban was imposed.
Another report later in the year alleged more than 1,000 Russians benefited from a doping cover-up between 2011 and 2015.
Russian officials have strongly denied there has been a state-sponsored doping programme.

===Input Doc/Src: A total of 2,488 medals, each weighing 500g, have been produced - with 812 gold, 812 silver and 864 bronze.
They were made with "sustainability at their heart", say organisers.
The gold medals are free from mercury, the silver and bronze medals are made from 30% recycled materials, and half of the plastic in their ribbons is from recycled plastic bottles.
The designs feature laurel leaves - a symbol of victory in ancient Greece - surrounding the Rio 2016 logo, and organisers say they celebrate "the relationship between the strengths of Olympic heroes and the forces of nature".
In line with the ecological theme of the Games, the podiums on which the athletes will receive the medals are made from organic materials and have been designed to be reused as furniture after the Games.
There are 2,642 Paralympic medals: 877 gold, 876 silver and 889 bronze and each has a device inside that uses tiny steel balls to make a sound when they are shaken, allowing visually impaired athletes to identify the colour by increasing in volume from bronze to gold.
The bronze medals have 16 steel balls and make the lowest sound, the silver medals have 20 balls and the golds have 28, producing the loudest noise.
All of the medals also have the words 'Rio 2016 Paralympic Games' written on them in Braille.

The event saw shorter routes for junior runners, with the main 13.1-mile event won by Steven Bayton and Sarah Lowery.
Among the runners were retired rugby league players Barrie McDermott and Keith Senior.
Lowery, the first woman to finish the circuit, said: "I had not done this race before so it's nice to do your local half marathon.
"There were loads of people in the crowd all the way round, even in the really remote parts of the course, so I really enjoyed the race."
Councillor Mary Lea, from Sheffield City Council, said: "Although the route is undoubtedly a challenging one, the view from the top of Ringinglow Road across the Peak District is surely one of the best rewards any weary runner could hope for.
"I would go as far as to say that Sheffield is surely the most picturesque of almost any city half marathon, when you consider the blend of the beautiful rural landscape and the vibrant city centre finish."

===Input Doc/Src: Ms Philbin has been honoured for her work in sparking young peoples' interest in working in science, technology and engineering.
She co-founded the TeenTech organisation, which holds events that introduce school children to technical and creative careers.
Ms Philbin has also had a long media career connected to science and tech.
Her broadcasting career began in the late 1970s when Ms Philbin  presented the pioneering BBC saturday morning children's show Multi-Coloured Swap Shop.
From there, she went on to work on the iconic BBC science show Tomorrow's World. During the eight years she worked on that programme, Ms Philbin was first to demonstrate many innovations including car navigation systems, fax machines and mobile phones.
More recently, Ms Philbin was a reporter on the BBC's Bang Goes The Theory science show, and has regularly appeared on other radio and TV programmes as an science expert.
In 2008, she helped to start the non-profit TeenTech organisation that aimed to give young people a realistic view of what it is like to work in jobs that have a high science, technology, engineering and mathematics component.
It regularly runs events that let school children talk to people that work in different technical sectors and lets them get a feel for the techniques, equipment and approaches used in those professions.
Ms Philbin said giving children an insight into the ways that innovation and advances occur was important because an increasing proportion of jobs revolved around competence in science, technology and maths.
It's hard to think of anyone in the last 30 years who has had quite such an impact on enthusing people - and in particular young people - about technology as Maggie Philbin.
People of my generation will remember her as the woman who introduced us to everything from sat-nav to digital cameras on Tomorrow's World.
But today she is doing amazing work to get teenagers thinking about learning technology skills through her TeenTech organisation.

===Input Doc/Src: There had been speculation the festival could be held elsewhere following remarks made earlier this year by founder Michael Eavis.
Eavis previously said he "didn't really want to have a year without a festival", and claimed the event could be held somewhere else in 2017 or 2018.
Tickets for next year's event go on sale in October, it has been confirmed.
In a statement on the Glastonbury Festival website, the organisers said: "We will be taking our next fallow year in 2018, in order to give the farm, the village and the festival team the traditional year off.
"There are no plans to hold an event at another location in 2018."
The music festival is held on the Eavis family's Worthy Farm in Somerset, south-west England, and traditionally takes a break every six years so as not to cause damage to the working fields.
The last fallow year was 2012.
In June, Eavis had told the BBC he was "talking to Longleat" as it was his "favourite site" for a new festival.
He had added that hosting it at Worthy Farm meant dealing with 22 different landowners, which "wasn't easy".
Next year's festival will take place from 21 to 25 June, with the first batch of tickets, for those buying coach packages, released on 6 October.
General tickets will be released three days later, at 09:00 BST on 9 October.
Last year's initial release of 120,000 tickets sold out in just over half an hour.
The highlight of the music calendar, this summer Glastonbury featured performances from headliners Adele, Coldplay and Muse, who rocked the Pyramid stage, festooned with a giant lightning bolt in honour of David Bowie.

Silva has made 58 appearances for Monaco this season - including two against City in the Champions League - scoring 11 goals and 12 assists.
He said the chance to work with Pep Guardiola influenced his decision.
"Of course when you have the opportunity of being trained by Guardiola, you don't say no," added the playmaker, who has played 12 times for Portugal, scoring once.
"If not the best coach in the world, he is one of the best."
Guardiola's City finished third in the Premier League this season, securing Champions League football next year.
Silva was integral to the Monaco side that reached the semi-finals, suffering eventual defeat to Juventus, who play Real Madrid in the final on Saturday, 3 June.
Former Tottenham midfielder Jermaine Jenas, speaking on BBC Radio 5 live
I am surprised in that I think that is the one area of the pitch where they have enough options. Manchester City's attack has been sensational this season. Bernardo Silva is very similar to David Silva. I wouldn't let David Silva go, I think he's been tremendous.
You don't know if other clubs were ready to push the button and City thought 'we have got to do it'. There are some players that come along and you have to do it there and then.
Tottenham defender Danny Rose, speaking on BBC Radio 5 live
I played against him away this season and he's the best opponent I faced. It's a great addition and gives Pep Guardiola another attacking option.

Silva was excellent in Monaco's 5-3 Champions League defeat at Etihad Stadium in February and Pep Guardiola decided the Portuguese was a man he wanted. So much so, in fact, that he is prepared to put him among the top five most expensive players in City history.
A product of the Benfica academy, Silva is an attacking right-sided midfield player and is, at 22, just the kind of age Guardiola likes - old enough to understand his role, youn

===Input Doc/Src: A year after a safety alert was first issued by Whirlpool, mystery shoppers for Which? were told that registering for a repair or replacement could take six to 12 weeks.
Whirlpool said it has now repaired two-thirds of the machines affected.
And it has told the BBC that waiting times can be as little as one month.
Fires have been caused by excess fluff, which can catch on the heating element. On one occasion earlier this year, a machine, awaiting a repair, caused a huge tower block fire in west London which left families homeless and needed 120 firefighters to bring under control.
Some five million affected machines were sold in the UK, under the Creda, Indesit and Hotpoint brands, between April 2004 and September 2015.
Whirlpool has been undertaking a repair programme and offering discounted replacements to anyone with an affected dryer.
There has been criticism of the speed of these modifications and of the company's advice that the machines can still be used as long as they are not left unattended.
At times earlier in the year, there were cases of people being told they must wait well over a year for an engineer to visit.
Now Which? has criticised the company for call handlers quoting six to 12 weeks for customers to simply receive an ID number.
A customer ID number needed to be issued before anything could happen in the repair or replacement process, the consumer group said.
"It is absolutely unacceptable that one year on, Whirlpool customers are still seeing slow, poor service and potentially receiving incorrect and dangerous advice," said Alex Neill, from Which?.
"Its modification programme is clearly not progressing as fast as it should."
However Whirlpool said it was making good progress with repairs.

===Input Doc/Src: The BBC found a disregard for health and safety on an estate in north-east India owned by Assam Company.
The Rainforest Alliance, an ethical certification organisation, has now stripped a group of Assam Company's plantations of its green frog seal.
The Assam Company said it was appealing against the decision. A group of Assam Company's estates lost its certification because "it was found to be in breach of critical criteria relating to the use of personal protective equipment", the Rainforest Alliance said in a statement.
The Assam Company said the loss of its certification was because of a "minor error" on one estate - Hajua - while spraying a plant extract, which it understood did not require personal protective equipment. It said that because the Assam company estates operate in a "single cluster", the other estates were automatically decertified.
Twinings, Taylors of Harrogate and Fortnum & Mason have suspended business with the company while Harrods took the tea off its shelves shortly after the investigation, which was broadcast in September.
Workers at the company's Hajua estate were seen spraying agrochemicals without the protective equipment employers are required to provide, when the BBC visited.
Men spraying reported breathing difficulties, numbness of the hands and face, a burning sensation on the skin and profound loss of appetite.
The Rainforest Alliance said its auditor confirmed the BBC's evidence of unsafe spraying and the organisation had tightened its rules on the subject.
Taylors of Harrogate said it will maintain a relationship with the estates and support efforts to improve standards.
Twinings plans to continue working with the Ethical Tea Partnership (ETP) - an organisation set up by UK tea companies to improve workers' lives - to monitor the working and living conditions on all the tea estates from which it buys. It also plans to conduct a review of the Assam estates it sources from in the next few months.

The Mail on Sunday also reported Lord Hall and his wife were under 24-hour protection from security guards at their Oxfordshire home.
The Met said the email appeared to have been sent from outside the UK.
"Police in Westminster are investigating an allegation of threats to kill," a Met spokesman said.
"The allegation was reported to police on Wednesday, 25 March.  The threat was made by email."
He said inquiries were continuing to establish from where the email was sent.
No arrests have been made.
A BBC spokeswoman said: "We wouldn't comment on security matters."
Lord Hall announced his decision not to renew Clarkson's contract on Wednesday - after an internal inquiry found the presenter had subjected producer Oisin Tymon to an "unprovoked physical and verbal attack" at a North Yorkshire hotel.
Mr Tymon, who suffered a split lip, did not file a formal complaint and it is understood Clarkson reported himself to BBC bosses following the incident, and was suspended.
The row - which took place on 4 March - was said to have occurred because no hot food was provided following a day's filming.
Lord Hall said he had not taken his decision lightly, but insisted "a line has been crossed".
More than a million people signed an online petition to reinstate Clarkson.
The Mail claimed the death threats were made to Lord Hall via email the same day as his announcement.
It also published photographs of security guards outside his home.
Mr Tymon, who previously described Clarkson as a "unique talent", has himself come under sustained abuse on social media for his involvement in the dispute.
Speaking outside his home on Thursday, Clarkson asked fans to show restraint.

Khodorkovsky flew to Germany after his release on 20 December.

"I think campaigning for the release of those who have been jailed without justification is the job of every ordinary citizen. As far as I'm concerned, it has nothing to do with politics," he added.
Khodorkovsky has not yet decided whether he wants to stay permanently in Switzerland, his spokesman said.
The businessman made his fortune from the controversial privatisation of Soviet state assets. In 1995, he acquired oil giant Yukos.
After President Vladimir Putin came to power Khodorkovsky made no secret of his support for the liberal opposition,
In 2005 he received an eight-year jail sentence for tax evasion, fraud and embezzlement. Two years before his release date he was convicted again on further charges of embezzlement and money laundering.
He had been due to be released next August, but requested a pardon because his mother is suffering from cancer.
The pardon came after Russian MPs backed a wide-ranging amnesty for at least 20,000 prisoners.

===Input Doc/Src: On Monday, Prime Minister David Cameron said Crewe could lose HS2 investment in a post-election Labour-SNP deal.
But SNP deputy leader Stewart Hosie described the comments as "utterly meaningless" and "preposterous".
Crewe's Labour candidate Adrian Heald said he would "not support any move to jeopardise the HS2 line at Crewe".
A report last year into the route of the high-speed rail line running north from London recommended a new station be built in Crewe.
But Mr Cameron said a minority Labour government, backed by the SNP, means schemes could be dropped.
The prime minister said projects linked to HS2 that could be jettisoned include Crewe's planned University Technical College and the Railway Exchange Training Academy.
Also speaking on Monday, Chancellor George Osborne said: "The SNP deputy leader has said in the last couple of days, if there was a minority Labour administration that needed SNP help to get their legislation through 'we might well say let's not have HS2 go to Manchester and Birmingham, let's have it start in Edinburgh and Glasgow'.
"That is tearing up the plan for huge investment in Crewe. That is cancelling the thousands of jobs and businesses that will come to this town.
"That is a billion pound blow to Crewe and is the price tag of voting for Labour and Ed Miliband here."
While Labour has ruled out a coalition with the SNP, Scottish nationalists for their part have said they could support a minority Labour government on an "issue-by-issue" basis.
Echoing the SNP's manifesto, Mr Hosie said he would like to see a Scottish section of HS2 built "at the same time" as the first phase planned between London and the West Midlands, allowing the line to "meet in the middle" of the country.
"Why would that put investment in Crewe at risk?" he said.

But Damascus rejected allegations it was preparing to use such weapons.

The 23-year-old pulled out of the 1-1 draw with Wigan as Leeds failed to reach the Championship play-offs.
"I'm hugely disappointed with Charlie. I think he's been terribly advised all season," Monk told BBC Radio Leeds.
Taylor has been with Leeds since the age of nine and has made 104 first-team appearances since his debut in August 2011.
However, he told the club last summer he did not want to open talks on a new deal and then had a transfer request rejected.
Monk suggested Taylor's head had been turned by the interest reportedly shown in him from Premier League clubs.
"I understand he's very young, and we've tried to help him and guide him from within, but it's very difficult to get him fully committed," he said.
"Had he had some better advice from the outside, I think we would have seen a better Charlie Taylor this season and left on better terms, if that's what's going to happen. But that's over to the club and the player now.

The letter, written by Mrs May's private secretary, says she believes the plan is "unacceptable".
On Tuesday, Mr Hunt set out a strategy to give UK tourism a boost following London's Games and said ministers were looking at simplifying visa applications for non-EU nationals.
The strategy focused on attracting visitors from China, where the government thinks there is potential to triple the number of tourists - generating more than Â£500m in extra spending and creating more than 14,000 jobs.
Currently, visitors can apply for a single visa to visit much of Europe - but a separate one is required to travel to the UK.
Countries such as France and Germany are far more successful at attracting Chinese visitors, and the UK could do better if getting a visa was easier, Mr Hunt has suggested.
But a letter from Mrs May's private secretary to the prime minister's private secretary said the current rules were a "key tool in protecting the public against significant harm".
There are already 400 Chinese criminals awaiting deportation and 1,000 asylum applications from Chinese citizens last year, it said.
"The proposal... is not acceptable to the home secretary for national security reasons," the letter said.
"We also face significant challenges with foreign national offenders and organised crime, including drugs, money laundering, fraud, criminal finances, intellectual property, immigration and cyber crime."
But Mark Tanzer, chief executive of the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta), said: "In the absence of concrete data about visa abuse, it is impossible to determine whether the right balance is being struck between the UK's commercial interests and its security needs."
He argued that "proper visa monitoring and reporting proc

Kerber, seeded seventh, won a thrilling final 6-4 3-6 6-4 at Melbourne Park.
The 28-year-old is the first German to win a major singles title since Steffi Graf at the 1999 French Open.
Williams, 34, was beaten for just the fifth time in 26 Grand Slam finals, and the American missed the chance to tie Graf's open-era record of 22 titles.
Kerber, who saved a match point in her first-round win over Misaki Doi, will move up to number two in the world rankings.
Kerber had won just one of six previous matches against Williams and was making her Grand Slam final debut, but she was the better player over two hours and eight minutes on Rod Laver Arena.
She led Williams in the ace count until the latter stages, limiting her to just seven overall, while the American racked up 46 errors to just 13 by Kerber.
Williams made 23 mistakes in the first set alone - sparking memories of her desperately nervous display in losing to Roberta Vinci at the US Open last September - and Kerber took full advantage to claim it after 39 minutes.
However, the defending champion cut her error count to just five in the second set and claimed it thanks to a single break in game four.
Kerber twice moved ahead in the decider and a stunning sixth game saw the German produce two fine drop shots and win a breathtaking 19-stroke rally to cling on to her serve and edge closer to victory.
Nerves took hold and she was broken while serving for the match, but she launched into the Williams serve once again and clinched the title when the world number one sent a volley long.
Kerber said afterwards that being able to say she was a Grand Slam champion "sounds crazy".
"It's my dream come. I worked for this my whole life," said the German.
"It's been such an up and down two weeks, I was match point down in the first round and had one foot in the plane to Germany.
"Now I have beaten Serena and won the championship. I have so many emotions, so many thoughts, but all of th

===Input Doc/Src: The hosts were closest to scoring in a cagey first half as Peter Whittingham's thunderous long-range shot hit the bar.
Gunnarsson won it for Cardiff with a swerving first-time effort from 25 yards, though Apostolos Vellios almost equalised but also hit the woodwork.
Forest drop to 21st place in the Championship table, just one point above the bottom three.
Cardiff, meanwhile, climb up to 13th after a third successive home win.
A significant day at the foot of the Championship saw four of Forest's relegation rivals taking each other on, with Blackburn hosting Bristol City and Birmingham at home to Burton.
Perhaps mindful of how tight things were in the bottom half, Mark Warburton's side started a little apprehensively against Cardiff, who were the first to threaten with Whittingham's booming 30-yard shot which crashed against the crossbar.
Other than that and a powerful long-range effort from Forest's Mustapha Carayol, there was precious little in terms of scoring opportunities in the first half.
There was more entertainment near the dugout, where Cardiff assistant manager Kevin Blackwell and his opposite number David Weir had to be separated after frayed tempers almost led to a scuffle.
Forest appeared to harness that emotion at half-time, emerging after the restart with renewed vigour and attacking intent.
Carayol looked their likeliest source of a goal, unnerving the home defence with his direct and quick running.
Despite the visitors' improvement, it was Cardiff who made the breakthrough as Kadeem Harris' cross was only half-cleared, leaving the ball to bobble invitingly into the path of Gunnarsson, who unleashed a fierce first-time shot which swerved beyond Jordan Smith and into the far corner.
Forest rallied, with substitutes Vellios and Britt Assombalonga threatening - but the former wasted their best opportunity as his looping header bounced on to the bar, stretching their winless run away from home to 11 league games.

Carlos Tuimavave and Fetuli Talanoa tries and a Jake Connor penalty gave Hull a 14-12 half-time lead, Cas' Ben Roberts and Zak Hardaker replying.
Connor kicked three more penalties and Roberts crossed again before Hull pulled away when Mahe Fonua and Jamie Shaul scored within two minutes.
Greg Minikin's late try set up a tense finish but Hull's defence stood strong.
Hull's victory set up a semi-final with Leeds Rhinos, while Wigan Warriors, winners against rivals Warrington on Saturday, face Salford Red Devils.
The defeat was only the Tigers' fourth of the season, having won eight successive matches going into the game, with their last loss also coming against Lee Radford's side.
The hosts had flown into a 12-0 lead early on when Tuimavave intercepted a pass to run nearly the full length of the pitch before Talanoa muscled off two defenders to cross.
But Roberts showed fleet of foot to find a gap and score, while Hardaker touched down Luke Gale's smart kick.
Connor's penalty kept Hull in the driving seat, and his kicks kept the score ticking over in the second, as Roberts once more found a gap to get his second try.
But Hull took a firm grip on the match thanks to two quickfire tries, and although Minikin barrelled his way through down the right, Cas' handling mistakes throughout the match came back to haunt them.
Hull head coach Lee Radford:
"I'm very proud of my players. There were plenty of special efforts and that was needed.
"This is the juicy part of the season, the excitement starts now.
"Leeds will be a tough semi-final. I don't think we've beaten them in nine games so it will be a challenging and tough Yorkshire derby. But these are the exciting game to be involved in."

===Input Doc/Src: Actions required to meet that target have been set out in a study for WWF Scotland, Friends of the Earth Scotland and RSPB Scotland.
The environmental groups have now called on the Scottish government to bring forward the necessary policies.
Ministers said the report was a "useful contribution" to the energy debate.
The report, based on independent analysis by Ricardo Energy and Environment, is called "The Energy of Scotland: Heating, moving and powering our lives from now to 2030".
It sets out how Scotland's climate targets could be met in "the most cost-effective way".
It found that to achieve these goals, half of all the country's energy will need to come from renewables by the end of the next decade.
The report suggested that by 2030:
It said other benefits would include the "creation of new jobs; warmer, healthier homes; and cleaner air helping reduce the burden on the NHS".
WWF Scotland director Lang Banks said: "This report shows that a 50% renewables target for all our energy needs by 2030 is not only needed, but that it is achievable.
"Ministers should now make this a Scottish government target and bring in the policies needed in its forthcoming energy strategy.
"Doing so would enable Scotland to enjoy the many economic and social benefits that the report suggests would take place as result of generating half of all our energy needs from renewables.
"Scotland is already seeing the economic and social benefits of shifting our electricity system to clean, climate-friendly, renewables generation."
He added: "However, with electricity accounting for just one quarter of our energy use, it's time to begin to reap the same benefits by increasing the use of renewables in our heat and transport sectors."
The Scottish government has already achieved a target to reduce emissions by at least 42% by 2020.
It also aims to generate 100% of Scotland's electricity from renewable sources by 2020.

But setting and remembering it can be as easy as singing your favourite song.
Here's our step-by-step guide to how lyrics can help you stay safe online.
We'll pick the Foo Fighters, because they're generally great. But it could be anyone you like, or U2. As long as you can remember some of the lyrics to one of their songs.
The catchier the better, to make sure you can remember those words. Something from Nothing seems like a good track to go for, fresh from the Foo's new album Sonic Highways.
It could be the chorus or the bit you like the most. We've gone for the opening lines: "Give me the flammable life, I'm cold as a match." Sing it, Dave.
Take the first letter of each word to make the basis of your password. That gives us GMTFLICAAM. Not bad, but it could someone who knows your music taste possibly guess it?
Mix lower and upper case letters to make the password a little harder to guess. You should end up with something like: GmTFLICaam
Swapping letters for numbers and symbols can make your password even more difficult to guess. So, a capital G looks a bit like 6, we'll swap F for 4 because four begins with f, L and I both look like 1s so that's an easy swap. The @ signs are a good alternative to the letter a. It probably goes without saying, but ours is just an example and not one you should use. Stay safe!

===Input Doc/Src: The Netherlands currently lead Namibia and Ireland by six points.
Batsmen William Porterfield and Ed Joyce return after being rested for the four-day tour game against Zimbabwe A.
Paul Stirling is also expected to take his place in the team after recovering from tightness in his quad.
Stirling did not bat in the final innings of Ireland's draw with Zimbabwe A as a precautionary measure.
Porterfield and Joyce instead spent time batting in the nets and both are expected to play, as is bowler Tim Murtagh, who was also rested.
In the potential scenario of the side winning the match after conceding a first innings lead, the Dutch will drop to third as in this situation the side that wins the match will collect 13 points while the side that claims the first innings lead will get seven points.
Namibia have been preparing for the game by playing in South African domestic cricket, while Ireland arrived in Windhoek directly from Harare, where they have spent the last three weeks playing three one-day internationals and a four-day match with Zimbabwe A.
In the first round of fixtures, reigning champions Ireland defeated the United Arab Emirates by an innings and 26 runs in Malahide in June, while Namibia recorded a 114-run victory over Hong Kong in May and will be aiming to make home advantage count against Porterfield's experienced side.
There has been one change to the original 14-man squad named by Ireland, with Max Sorensen returning home from Zimbabwe with a back injury, the impressive Stuart Poynter comes into the squad in his place.
Poynter goes into the match on the back of scoring his maiden first-class century in the final tour match in Harare, while Stirling, Gary Wilson, Kevin O'Brien, John Mooney and Niall O'Brien all made half-centuries in Zimbabwe.
With conditions at the Wanderers Club very similar to those in Zimbabwe, Ireland are well acclimatised and required the minimal recovery time after their travel day to Windhoek.

Two men from Buckinghamshire and a third from the London area, all of whom were in the car, died.
A fourth man, who was also in the car, has been taken to Oxford's John Radcliffe Hospital.
No-one on the coach was injured.
Bedfordshire Police said the double-decker coach collided with the Audi while it was stationary on the hard shoulder.
"The coach driver was arrested in connection with the incident and taken to Luton Police Station where he is being interviewed," a police spokesman said.
It is understood the cheerleading team are from a university in Kent and were on their way to a sporting event in Birmingham when the crash happened.

The review will be published at 11:00 BST and details of anyone earning more than £150,000 a year will be included.

It may also examine the issue of the competition, such as Netflix.
It looks back over the previous year's performance and publishes details about the corporation's finances and spending. This year's edition could prove more interesting than most.
It's all down to the government's culture secretary, Karen Bradley.
Speaking in the House of Commons last September, Mrs Bradley said publishing the salaries of stars earning more than £150,000 would bring the BBC "in line with the civil service" on transparency.
The culture secretary said it would help ensure the BBC "produces value for money for the licence fee" and that more transparency could lead to savings that could be "invested in even more great programmes".
But the BBC's director general, Tony Hall, has said: "Our position on talent pay has not changed and all major broadcasters have questioned the merit of the proposal.
"The BBC operates in a competitive market and this will not make it easier for the BBC to retain the talent the public love."
ITV's programmes chief, Kevin Lygo, also called the proposal a "mean-spirited, nosey way of looking at things" during last year's Edinburgh Television Festival.
The corporation already reveals the salary details of on-air stars who earn more than £450,000 and executives who earn more than £150,000.
Presenters such as Graham Norton, Gary Lineker, Claudia Winkleman, Chris Evans, Fiona Bruce and Andrew Marr could easily be on the list.
The revelations are required under the BBC's new Royal Charter, and are expected to encompass more than 100 of its top stars.

===Input Doc/Src: The watercolour, attributed to Queen Victoria's favourite artist Sir Edwin Landseer, was sold by JP Humbert of Whittlebury, Northamptonshire.
The painting has attracted both firm supporters and those who doubt whether it does depict the Brontes.
It was sold to a collector who plans to do more research and resell it.
Bidding took off just 15 minutes before the end of the "timed" online auction with the painting sold for £40,550 hammer price (£50,038 including buyers premium) to an private investor believed to be based in the UK.
Auctioneer Jonathan Humbert said: "We are very pleased our theory has been accepted and endorsed by the establishment.
"The evidence was compelling that this is the Brontes as painted by Landseer and its successful sale has proved that research and factual evidence will overcome apathy and negativity."
Mr Humbert had decided to pull the picture, which he believes to be of "national importance", from an auction in 2012 so more research could be done.
Landseer was a popular Victorian painter best known for his animal portraits and designing the bronze lions in London's Trafalgar Square.
The Bronte family moved to Haworth, West Yorkshire, in 1820 where the Reverend Patrick Bronte was appointed Curate of Haworth.
They lived at the Haworth Parsonage from 1820 to 1861, which is now the Bronte Parsonage Museum.

===Input Doc/Src: Groups of tourists, fresh off the ferry from Cape Town, pass by with barely a glance.
But for Mr Mandela, the garden held a special value. And if you stand inside the tiny cell where South Africa's struggle icon spent 18 years hidden from the world, and peer through the barred window into the high-walled courtyard, you can just make out the thin strip of green and brown foliage where he once tended tomatoes and chillies.
"A garden was one of the few things in prison that one could controlâ€¦ The sense of being the custodian of this small patch of earth offered a small taste of freedom," Mr Mandela wrote in his autobiography, Long Walk To Freedom - an early draft of which, incidentally, he tried to hide from the prison guards by burying in the garden.
Today, the garden's weeds - and the rotting stump of an apple tree - hint at the alleged mismanagement and corruption that have blighted Robben Island for years.
But along one wall, two grape vines now stand out in sharp contrast - the lush green foliage of a promising harvest suspended on a wooden frame.
"They're still growing, thriving, regardless of the difficult conditions on the island. They're very much a symbol of the resilience of the leaders imprisoned here," said Philip Jonker, a South African wine maker as he and two colleagues carefully pruned the vines by hand.
It is seven years since Mr Jonker first spotted the two plants on a family visit to the island.
It is not clear whether Mr Mandela himself tended the vines or whether, as seems more likely, they were planted shortly after he was transferred to another prison on the mainland. But Mr Jonker sees them - there are seven vines around the prison in total - as part of the island's heritage, and a way of preserving "South African history in a bottle".
After four years of petitioning, he finally secured permission to tend the vines, and, last year, to take the first harvest - previous ones had been devoured by the island's ravenous birds - back to his Weltevr

The witness told the inquiry: "If someone did it in the public eye, he'd go to court, he'd get sentenced and he'd serve time.
"If he'd got a habit on, if you're a Christian Brother then it seemed to be a free-for-all.
"We knew what would happen if you told somebody, especially in authority, they would say 'this doesn't happen here.'"

He went on to claim that Brother Murphy was later "transferred from place to place" to effectively hide him.
He said his time at the orphanage still haunted him and was "probably something I will never forget".
He had bottled it up for nearly 30 years and had only chosen to speak out when he found out about the inquiry, he added.
Life for the orphans involved hard physical labour including pulling down trees, clearing land, digging out a swimming pool and building a handball court by chipping bricks.
"You had to chip X amount of bricks before you can knock off, before you had something to eat," he told the inquiry, which is looking into abuse in England and Wales.
The boys wore only a grey shirt and shorts, no matter what the weather, he said.
There were no underpants and shoes were only worn when somebody important visited, otherwise feet were bare, he added.
Brothers would be fully clothed with shoes and gloves while the boys shivered in the cold, he said.
The inquiry also heard from another former child migrant, Oliver Cosgrove, who is now in his late sixties and who also lived at Castledare.

Its report, written with Age UK, was based on 161 patients and 57 staff completing questionnaires, as well as six focus groups and 10 case studies.
The majority of patients were still treated with dignity, the report added.
Patients with communication difficulties and dementia were particularly unhappy with their care.
One patient, who had suffered a stroke, said she was left for hours in her own excrement.
She said: "I was sedated and my health needs were neglected."
Another described finding her mother-in-law, who has Alzheimer's, "soaked, dirty" and ignored by nurses.
Their report said that, in a small number of cases, their experiences were "shocking".
A woman who suffers from trigeminal neuralgia, a condition which causes severe facial pain, said that while she was normally treated with respect, on one occasion she was called "unclean" by a staff member when she was in too much pain to wash.
Healthwatch also found people were often reluctant to complain and did not always feel properly involved in decisions about their care.
But 93% of patients who responded said they had been treated with dignity or respect "some of the time", "most of the time" or "always".
While patients were receiving "a high level of dignity in their care", Healthwatch chief executive Rachel Coney said there was "still much that can be improved about how people are treated".

Mr Brokenshire said: "Over the summer I have kept in touch with the political parties and I will be bringing them together over the next week as we enter a new phase of talks.
"Urgent progress is required. The lack of an executive making key decisions on matters including health and education means that public services in Northern Ireland are suffering.
"We need to find a way forward that will allow an executive to be formed."
Mr Coveney said he planned to visit Belfast next week to meet politicians.
"Northern Ireland needs a voice through a government of its own," he said. "We need to see a resumption to those discussions and hopefully a conclusion as soon as possible.
"We don't want talks that are ongoing for a long period of time."
Sinn FÃ©in's northern leader has written to the UK and Irish governments proposing a formal resumption of power-sharing talks.
Michelle O'Neill suggested parties should be given a tight deadline from next Monday to restore the government.
The Democratic Unionist Party's (DUP) Simon Hamilton described her proposal as a "stunt", saying his party had been ready to form an executive for months.
Northern Ireland has been without a functioning devolved government since January.
The coalition led by the two biggest parties, the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in, collapsed over a green energy scandal.

===Input Doc/Src: The 27-year-old was a key part of the Foxes side that won the Premier League in 2015-16, but asked to leave the club amid interest from the Blues.
Chelsea have also signed defender Davide Zappacosta from Torino on a four-year deal for an undisclosed fee.
However, striker Fernando Llorente opted for Tottenham instead of a move to Stamford Bridge.
And Everton midfielder Ross Barkley changed his mind about joining Antonio Conte's side.
Leicester expect to confirm the signing of Adrien Silva, 28, from Sporting Lisbon on Friday for £22m as a midfield replacement.
Drinkwater played in 35 of Leicester's 38 league games in their title-winning season and formed an impressive midfield partnership with N'Golo Kante, who joined Chelsea last July.
He has yet to play this season because of a thigh injury.
The playmaker, who joined Leicester in 2012 from Manchester United, has won three England caps since making his international debut in March 2016.
"I'm delighted to be a Chelsea player and can't wait to get started," said Drinkwater. "It has been a long journey to get here but I am very happy and am looking forward to helping the club win more trophies."
Zappacosta has been capped four times by Italy, with Blues boss Conte handing him his first call-up to the national squad in May 2016.
The 25-year-old full-back joined Torino from Atalanta in 2015 and made 29 Serie A appearances last season.
"I hope I can show my quality to the coach, my team-mates and the supporters," said Zappacosta.

===Input Doc/Src: Dayow Mohamed Hassan, 44, was buried neck-deep and pelted to death with stones by al-Shabab fighters.
He was convicted of being in an adulterous relationship with a woman and impregnating her, despite having two wives, an official said.
Al-Shabab occasionally passes such sentences for sexual offences in areas it controls in Somalia.
In 2014, a teenage boy was stoned to death after being convicted of raping a woman.
In 2008, a young girl was killed in a similar manner after being convicted of adultery.
In the latest case, a  woman filed a complaint of rape against Hassan, but the court tried him for adultery as it is easier to prove, says BBC Somali's Mohamed Mohamed.
Hundreds of people watched him being stoned death in Ramo Adey village in the south-central Bay region, said Moalim Geedow, the al-Shabab governor for the area.
"The man had a third woman who was a divorcee... He deceived her, saying that he went to a sheikh [religious leader] and that he married her," Mr Geedow told Reuters news agency.
"However, when the woman got pregnant, the two families debated and there was no trace of valid matrimony. The court ruled he did not marry her legally and he was stoned to death."
Al-Shabab is fighting to overthrow the weak UN-backed government in Somalia and impose its own strict interpretation of Islamic law.
It has lost control of many towns and cities to a 22,000-strong African Union force supporting the government.
But the group, linked to al-Qaeda, still has a strong presence in many rural areas.

===Input Doc/Src: The Lincolnshire side reached round one for the first time by beating National League Wrexham 3-2 after extra-time in a fourth qualifying round replay.
Stamford, who play in the eighth tier Northern Premier League Division One South, now face League One Hartlepool.
"We're on a bonus for the FA Cup and we're determined to go to America," manager Graham Drury said.
"At the minute we've got nearly £2,000 and if we beat Hartlepool in the next round I'll be saying to the chairman I want another £5,000 to go into that players' pot.
"That's our goal, our dream, to send the boys to America."
Drury, who led Conference North side Corby Town into the first round of the FA Cup five years ago, took over as manager of Stamford last season but was unable to save them from relegation from the Northern Premier League Premier Division.
And he said was delighted to make club history by giving them some cup success.
"When I came into Stamford at the back end of Christmas last year they'd won one home game in 18 months," Drury told BBC Radio Lincolnshire.
"We've turned that round and made Stamford a bit of a fortress. We've lost one game here this season and we've played some top-quality sides.
"We've stuck at it and we've got our rewards, and to take them to the first round proper, I'm a very proud man."

===Input Doc/Src: So often repeated are the words of the Swedish diplomat Dag Hammarskjold, the organisation's most beloved secretary general, they have come to serve as a mission statement of sorts.
Additionally, they function as a crude benchmark against which the work of the United Nations can be judged.
When the organisation was formed in 1945, in the aftermath of World War Two and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, "hell" would have been the outbreak of a third global conflict and nuclear Armageddon, neither of which has come to pass.
But in those post-War years, as the full horror of the Holocaust was uncovered, "hell" also meant genocide, a word which had only just been coined: the systematic massacre of thousands of people because of their ethnicity, religion, race or nationality.
Here, the UN has not always been able to halt the descent into the abyss.
To its member states' eternal shame, on some occasions it has been a bystander to genocide.
In any historical ledger, Rwanda and Srebrenica stand out as ghastly failures.
During the Rwanda genocide, UN peacekeepers deployed in the country concentrated on evacuating expatriates and government officials, failing to intervene as 800,000 Tutsis and sympathetic Hutus were slaughtered.
In Srebrenica in July 1995, more than 8,000 Muslims, mainly men and boys, were massacred by Bosnian Serb forces, which barged past Dutch soldiers wearing the distinctive blue helmet of the UN peacekeepers as if they weren't there.
What made the massacre all the more horrifying was that the Muslims had sheltered in enclaves deemed "safe areas" under the protections of the UN.
In some conflicts, such as Yugoslavia, the UN was slow to respond.
In others, such as Vietnam and the Iraq war, it was sidelined.
Its efforts to broker peace talks during Syria's civil war, now in its fifth year, have always ended in failure.
Now, a third UN envoy, the Italian diplomat Staffan de Mistura, is trying, without success so far, to break the impasse.

===Input Doc/Src: More mothers now need surgery to deliver a baby due to their narrow pelvis size, according to a study.
Researchers estimate cases where the baby cannot fit down the birth canal have increased from 30 in 1,000 in the 1960s to 36 in 1,000 births today.
Historically, these genes would not have been passed from mother to child as both would have died in labour.
Researchers in Austria say the trend is likely to continue, but not to the extent that non-surgical births will become obsolete.
Dr Philipp Mitteroecker, of the department of theoretical biology at the University of Vienna, said there was a long standing question in the understanding of human evolution.
"Why is the rate of birth problems, in particular what we call fetopelvic disproportion - basically that the baby doesn't fit through the maternal birth canal - why is this rate so high?" he said.
"Without modern medical intervention such problems often were lethal and this is, from an evolutionary perspective, selection.
"Women with a very narrow pelvis would not have survived birth 100 years ago. They do now and pass on their genes encoding for a narrow pelvis to their daughters."
It has been a long standing evolutionary question why the human pelvis has not grown wider over the years.
The head of a human baby is large compared with other primates, meaning animals such as chimps can give birth relatively easily.
The researchers devised a mathematical model using data from the World Health Organization and other large birth studies.
They found opposing evolutionary forces in their theoretical study.
One is a trend towards larger newborns, which are more healthy.
However, if they grow too large, they get stuck during labour, which historically would have proved disastrous for mother and baby, and their genes would not be passed on.
"One side of this selective force - namely the trend towards smaller babies - has vanished due to Caesarean sections," said Dr Mitteroecker.
"Our intent is not to criticise medical inte

===Input Doc/Src: Zia Haider Rahman's critically acclaimed debut, In the Light of What We Know, picked up the James Tait Black fiction prize on Monday evening.
The Valley: A Hundred Years in the Life of a Yorkshire Family by Richard Benson won the biography prize.
The two prizes are awarded annually by the University of Edinburgh.
Chairman of the James Tait Black Prize for fiction, Professor Randall Stevenson, said of the winning fiction entry: "Zia Haider Rahman addresses a whole range of issues - the war in Afghanistan, the rise of Muslim fundamentalism and the banking crisis.
"Moreover, he also explores problematic areas of politics and finance, which are often exiled from the pages of fiction, immersing his readers, dauntingly but comprehensibly.
"The novel's impressive scope is complemented by Rahman's ability to locate the personal in the political."
Benson's The Valley: A Hundred Years in the Life of a Yorkshire Family, sees the author draw on his own family history set in a mining community.
Biography judge Dr Jonathan Wild said: "Richard Benson's book represents a remarkable reclamation of a once prevalent social group now almost entirely gone."
Each winner receives Â£10,000 each in prize money.
The James Tait Black Awards were founded in 1919 by Janet Coats, the widow of publisher James Tait Black, to commemorate her husband's love for books.
Previous winners include DH Lawrence, Graham Greene, Angela Carter and Ian McEwan.

===Input Doc/Src: Mrs Clinton is the highest-ranking US official to visit South Sudan since it gained independence last July.
A UN deadline for the nations to resolve disputes over their border and oil transit fees passed on Thursday.
South Sudan is the second stop of Mrs Clinton's seven-country African tour.
The row over oil has led to huge economic problems in both countries - South Sudan has suspended all oil production, accusing Khartoum of stealing its exports, while austerity measures have sparked weeks of protests in Khartoum.
"We need to get those [oil] resources flowing again," Mrs Clinton told reporters after talks lasting more than an hour with South Sudanese President Salva Kiir.
"A percentage of something is better than a percentage of nothing," she said, according to the Reuters news agency.
At independence, the South took three-quarters of Sudan's oil with it but all the pipelines still flow north.
"While South Sudan and Sudan have become separate states, their fortunes and their futures remain inextricably linked," Mrs Clinton said.
"Both countries will need to compromise to close the remaining gaps between them."
Ms Clinton's visit to South Sudan came nearly a month after the new state celebrated its first anniversary of independence, which was brought about by a 2005 peace deal between Sudan and the then southern rebels.
The two countries came close to all-out war in April, when South Sudanese troops briefly occupied the disputed oil-rich border area of Heglig.
Negotiations between the two countries in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, aimed at resolving all outstanding issues, are currently stalled.
Arriving from Senegal via the Ugandan capital Kampala, Mrs Clinton spent only a few hours in Juba before returning to Uganda.
Remarks by Mrs Clinton in Senegal which seemed to criticise China's involvement in Africa were met with a stinging rebuke by the Chinese state media on Friday.

The bank has promised to improve its returns to customers.
"The main focus is on fundamentally improving our overall client service standards and further professionalising our asset management services," IOR chairman Jean-Baptiste de Franssu said in a statement.
As part of the overhaul, the bank pledged to screen all its accounts, bringing in anti-money laundering experts to carry out the task. As a result it has closed more than 4,000 accounts since May 2013, most of which were dormant, but 554 of which were closed because they did not meet the bank's new standards for clients.

===Input Doc/Src: York's National Railway Museum (NRM) has launched an appeal to mark the Flying Scotsman's 93rd birthday.
The engine, which retired from service in 1963, has been restored for the NRM in a decade-long, £4.2m refit.
On Saturday it ventured on to the mainline network for the first time in 40 years as it took a test run through Cumbria and Lancashire.
Last month, the locomotive emerged into the East Lancashire Railway's Bury Bolton Street station after the final stages of the work at a nearby yard, thrilling hundreds of rail enthusiasts.
It is due to be painted in its new green livery on Wednesday and have its nameplates reattached before making its journey between London Kings Cross and York on 25 February.
Public services will begin later this month, alongside an exhibition at the museum.
Former fireman John Morgan, from Peterborough, said he was looking forward to seeing the Flying Scotsman steaming between the two cities again.
The 77-year-old became a fireman at 16 and worked on some of the most famous locomotives of the age, including the Flying Scotsman and the Mallard, the world's fastest steam train.
"I have a lot of very good memories of 60103 [Flying Scotsman's British Rail number]," he said.
"I did a lot of trips on the footplate and shovelled a lot of coal.
"There was a lot of interest, even back then. Whenever we'd back up into King's Cross there'd be a crowd of people around wanting to get up into the cab."
Bob Gwynne, associate curator of collections and research at the NRM, said: "As we've been planning our highly anticipated Scotsman Season, many people have already approached us with their special connections to the iconic steam locomotive and the famous train it was named after.
"We've heard from crew members that worked on board and their families, and even of some babies born on the train."

===Input Doc/Src: The picture sees 163 of this year's nominees gathered together and smiling away, but zoom in and there is a whole lot more going on.
Here are just seven of the things we spotted in this year's photo.
1. Pharrell Williams didn't exactly dress for the occasion
All of this year's male nominees are dressed smartly in tuxes and suits. Well, almost all.
The "dress code" memo must have gone into Pharrell's junk email inbox, because he turned up wearing a green baseball cap and grey sweater.
To be fair - the sweater does have the Nasa logo on it, a reference to best picture nominee Hidden Figures.
Pharrell wrote several songs for the soundtrack to the film, which tells the story of three African-American women who worked behind the scenes at the space agency in the 1960s.
2. Michelle Williams is upstaged by Casey Affleck's facial hair
Casey Affleck's facial hair is fast becoming the eighth wonder of the world. It gets longer with every awards ceremony he appears at this season.
It's now on the verge of totally eclipsing poor Michelle Williams, Affleck's co-star in Manchester by the Sea, who has to peep out from behind his mane.
She must be used to Affleck stealing her limelight.
The actor appears in nearly every scene in the 137-minute movie, while Williams's screen time clocks in at 11 minutes.
3. The writer of Moonlight wants you to know how many nominations it has
Tarell Alvin McCraney brightens up the back row of the photograph with his winning smile.
He's the man behind the stage play In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue - which went on to become Moonlight, one of this year's most hotly-tipped Oscars contenders.
McCraney is so pleased with the film's success he wants to let you know just how many Oscar nominations the film has received, and he is seen here holding up eight fingers.
(There is, of course, another explanation. He could be making the "305" hand gesture - which is the area code for Miami-Dade county, his home and the place where Moonlight is set.)

Darren McCurry and Peter Harte led the charge with a combined total of 10 points as the Red Hands recovered from a slow start to triumph at Clones.
Mickey Harte's holders will play Derry at Pairc Esler on Saturday in a repeat of the 2016 final.
Derry saw off Monaghan 2-12 to 1-13 in the other semi-final at Armagh.
Fermanagh started the game with a flourish, driven by energy and desire, and they ran at the Tyrone defence at every opportunity, using support runners to stretch their opponents.
They went ahead through Eddie Courtney and Tomas Corrigan, and the Tyrone defence was under sustained pressure.
Midfielder Eoin Donnelly charged through with a goal on his mind, but he was denied by a superb Peter Harte block.
Tyrone finally got their opening score in the 10th minute when McCurry split the posts, and Niall McKenna brought the holders level moments later.
The Tyrone defence grew in stature as the game wore on, and restricted the Erne men to just one point in the second quarter, a third free for Corrigan.
An injury to Colm Cavanagh saw older brother Sean enter the action on the half-hour for his first appearance of 2017 and the beginning of a 16th season in the Tyrone county colours.
Harte's fourth free sent Tyrone in with a 0-7 to 0-4 interval lead, and they started moving more freely in the second period, with McCurry taking over the free-taking  duties, as well as adding a magnificent effort from play.
They went ahead by 0-10 to 0-5 and, after Paul McCusker had pulled back an Erne point, the Red Hands went 0-13 to 0-6 up, with McCurry, Cathal McShane and Lee Brennan hitting the target.
Fermanagh introduced Sean Quigley, who landed a couple of long range frees, with Aidan Breen and Corrigan also on target, but the holders held out for a place in the final.
---Sum/Tgt: Tyrone overcame a stubborn Fermanagh side 0-14 to 0-11 to reach the Dr McKenna Cup final and stay on course for a sixth successive title.

===Input Doc/Src: Chief executive Véronique Laury said the aim was to "leverage the scale of the business by becoming a single, unified company".
Details of the "ONE Kingfisher" plan came ahead of an investor day.
Investors reacted negatively to the move, sending Kingfisher shares down 6.1% to 324p in afternoon trading.
The slide made it the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 on Monday.
The retailer, which also owns Screwfix as well as Castorama in France, will face more competition following the sale of Homebase to Wesfarmers.
The Australian company plans to rebrand the DIY chain as Bunnings and revamp stores.
Ms Laury said improving Kingfisher's digital capability was one of its priorities.
Clive Black, head of research at Shore Capital, said: "It looks like Kingfisher is coming to terms with the realities of the limitations of large shops, so a focus upon the digital age. We think shareholders will welcome the focus on digital over stores and the return of cash, albeit the exceptional costs are substantial."
Independent retail analyst Nick Bubb said that the plan's goals would involve costs of up to £800m.
"The benefits aren't as clear-cut as you might think, although the news that Kingfisher also intend to return about £600m of capital to shareholders over the next three years (via share buybacks) will provide some comfort," he said.
Investec analyst Kate Calvert said the potential returns for shareholders outlined in the plan did not outweigh the risks involved.
"There are a lot of moving parts and no guarantee that all the costs will fall out and the profits come through," she said.
Kingfisher also said Rakhi Parekh, a former Amazon UK executive, had been appointed a non-executive director.

Supt Hassall said Mr Preston was last seen by his mum, Isobel, as "he waved from his bedroom window to her when she left for work at 08:45" BST from their home in Heath Road, Bebington.
"Isobel said there had been no arguments and Steven had left home without his jacket or prescription for medication he was on", he said.
He was reported missing five days later but was never found.
"Today a painstaking search is being carried out following information recently obtained by detectives, which suggest that Steven may have been murdered and buried in a specific area of land near to junction 5 of the M53 motorway", Supt Hassall added.
Mr Preston's sister, Jane, said she was "anxious to find out what happened to her brother after all these years."
She said he was "a gentle, kind and funny lad" who "didn't have a nasty bone in him."
"He adored my mum and it destroyed her when he disappeared. She knew instantly that he wouldn't have just left and never contact her again and that something awful must have happened to him", she said.
Supt Hassall appealed for information, saying: "Sadly, Steven's mother, Isobel, and half-brother, Michael Connolly have died since his disappearance, never knowing what had happened to him.
"A young man in 20s doesn't just leave home and vanish into thin air. Somebody, somewhere must know where he is, or what happened to him."

===Input Doc/Src: The University of Southampton team looked at available medical studies and found evidence the two were linked.
But there was no proof that one necessarily caused the other.
It may be that people taking anti-depressants put on weight which, in turn, increases their diabetes risk, the team told Diabetes Care journal.
Or the drugs themselves may interfere with blood sugar control.
Their analysis of 22 studies involving thousands of patients on anti-depressants could not single out any class of drug or type of person as high risk.
Prof Richard Holt and colleagues say more research is needed to investigate what factors lie behind the findings.
And they say doctors should keep a closer check for early warning signs of diabetes in patients who have been prescribed these drugs.
With 46 million anti-depressant prescriptions a year in the UK, this potential increased risk is worrying, they say.
Prof Holt said: "Some of this may be coincidence but there's a signal that people who are being treated with anti-depressants then have an increased risk of going on to develop diabetes.
"We need to think about screening and look at means to reduce that risk."
Diabetes is easy to diagnose with a blood test, and Prof Holt says this ought to be part of a doctor's consultation.
"Diabetes is potentially preventable by changing your diet and being more physically active.
"Physical activity is also good for your mental health so there's a double reason to be thinking about lifestyle changes."
Around three million people in the UK are thought to have diabetes, with most cases being type 2.
Dr Matthew Hobbs of Diabetes UK, said: "These findings fall short of being strong evidence that taking anti-depressants directly increases risk of type 2 diabetes. In this review, even the studies that did suggest a link showed only a small effect and just because two things tend to occur together, it doesn't necessarily mean that one is causing the other.

===Input Doc/Src: The Mail calls Spider-Man: Homecoming "the blockbuster of the summer", while The Guardian calls it a "light, snappy and frequently hilarious crowdpleaser".
According to Screen Daily reviewer Tim Grierson, British actor Tom Holland - a former star of the Billy Elliot musical who turned 21 this month - "makes for a believably underage Peter Parker".
The Hollywood Reporter, though, says "a charming new lead only goes so far".
Jon Watts' film, writes critic John DeFore, is "often frustrating" and "represents a creative mis-step" for the Marvel Studios.
Largely set in New York, Spider-Man: Homecoming follows on from Holland's introduction to the "MCU" - Marvel Cinematic Universe - in Captain America: Civil War.
That 2016 film saw Spider-Man - a teenage crime-fighter who can spin webs and swing between tall buildings - participate in a battle between Captain America, Iron Man and other superheroes.
The new film sees Spider-Man's alter ego Peter Parker juggling his high school responsibilities with his secret life as a masked vigilante.
It is not long before he encounters Adrian Toomes, a villainous arms dealer who has his own alter-ego in the form of wing-sporting marauder Vulture.
Previous versions of the Spider-Man franchise featured Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield in the title role.
According to Digital Spy, "Spider-Man: Homecoming's biggest achievement is that it makes you forget it's the third different Spider-Man - and second reboot - in less than 20 years."
"There's a spontaneous charge to the film, a euphoric innocence, that makes it a much-needed antidote to stale franchise formula," raves Rolling Stone's Peter Travers.
Variety's Owen Gleiberman, meanwhile, praises the "sinister, gnashing personality" Keaton brings to his role while wishing he had been "given more to do".
"Homecoming is easily the best Spider-Man film since Sam Raimi's operatic Spider-Man 2," concludes Empire's Nick De Semlyen, one of several critics to give the movie four stars out of five.

The couple subsequently vowed to postpone their nuptials until same-sex marriage becomes legal in Australia.
Dressed in "Say I Do Down Under" T-shirts at the Arias in Sydney, the pair urged the change to come next year.
"We're here to introduce a shining light in the Australian music industry," Minogue told the audience on Wednesday night.
"But we're also here to say thank you to everyone who has supported Josh's campaign for equality."
Sasse, who founded the "Say I Do Down Under" campaign, said: "This is more than a movement, this is people's lives and we want to say to every single member of the LGBT community that you are not alone.
"You have a voice and if we all stand together we can bring Australia back on the right side of history and make 2017 the year that we can all say 'I do' down under."
Australian pop star Sia also used the awards night to address the issue, sending a same-sex marriage campaigner to collect her award for best female artist.
The Australian government's plan to settle the same-sex marriage debate through a public vote early next year was blocked by the Senate two weeks ago.
Critics said a nationwide campaign would be expensive, unnecessary and unleash a torrent of homophobic rhetoric.

===Input Doc/Src: Ovidio Gonzalez was suffering from terminal throat cancer and said he had been suffering unbearable pain.
Colombia's Catholic Church has said euthanasia is morally unacceptable and it has threatened to close its hospitals across the country.
Colombia is one of the few countries in the world, and the only one in Latin America, where euthanasia is allowed.
Assisted suicide was approved by the Constitutional Court in the 1990s. But no procedures had been performed because the measure had not been regulated.
It was only in May that the health ministry intervened and issued a set of guidelines for hospitals.
Mr Gonzalez died in a clinic in the western city of Pereira, after a legal battle.
His son Julio Cesar is a cartoonist with one of Colombia's top newspapers, El Tiempo.
"My father received the news [that the procedure had been approved] with relief," said Mr Gonzalez, better known by his pen name Matador, or The Killer.
"It is a pity that it had to be like that. My dad deserved to go with less publicity," he added.
Euthanasia is highly controversial in the predominantly Roman Catholic country.
Critics also point out that the measure has not been voted by Congress.

===Input Doc/Src: During the election campaign, David Cameron talked about how the government needs to save £1 from every £100 it spends - so 3% should put it well ahead of where it needs to be.
Unfortunately, it's not that simple. Today's announcement highlights why that 1% cuts figure was not entirely helpful.
The first problem is that things get more expensive, even at a time when the official measure of inflation is negative.
The National Health Service gets more expensive every year because the population is growing and ageing and because as medical science advances there are more things that can be treated.
Indeed, the government has promised an extra £8bn above inflation to the NHS by 2020, which will presumably have to be made up through further cuts in other departments.
Education spending is protected for children aged five to 16 in terms of cash per pupil, so rising pupil numbers would also need to be made up for by cuts elsewhere.
And international aid is protected and will rise in line with the amount the economy grows.
There are other areas of spending that the government will struggle to cut. Although the amount it is borrowing each year is falling, the total amount it has borrowed is still increasing, which means interest must be paid on more money, albeit at a very low interest rate.
The cost of public sector pensions keeps growing as more civil servants retire and live longer.
And the state pension is triply protected, rising by inflation, wages or 2.5%, whichever is the higher.
To deal with all this, the government is planning to cut £12bn from the welfare bill and save £5bn by cutting back on tax avoidance, but most of the rest comes from cutting spending in unprotected departments. And 3% cuts would not be enough.
The Institute for Fiscal Studies reckons that the current plans to cut spending by 1% for the next two years and then freeze it for a third will actually mean cuts for unprotected departments averaging 5.4% a year for three years.
Which is not to say th

===Input Doc/Src: Stephen Ngila has been arrested for allegedly attacking Jackline Mwende almost two weeks ago, reports say.
Kenya has high levels of domestic abuse but Mrs Mwende's case was "particularly shocking", activists added.
Mr Ngila has not yet commented.
Mrs Mwende, 27, said a drunk Mr Ngila, 34, told her "today is your last day" before he attacked her at her parents' home in a village in southern Machakos County, Kenya's Daily Nation newspaper reports.
This was despite the fact that doctors told them she was fertile and he was impotent, Mrs Mwende was quoted as saying.
A video of her with stitches on her head and stumps where her hands once were, wrapped in bandages, has also been shown by Kenyan media.
The couple were living separately when Mr Ngila allegedly attacked Mrs Mwende, reports said.
Reuters news agency quotes Kenyan women's rights group Equality Now as saying that Mr Ngila has been charged with attempted murder, but there has been no independent confirmation of this.
"This is a particularly shocking case for Kenya... even though domestic violence is rampant," Naitore Nyamu of Equality Now told Reuters.
"We can't afford to let the perpetrators act with impunity - which has sometimes been the case in recent years," she added.
The chairwoman of Kenya's Federation of Women Lawyers (FIDA), Josephine Mong'are, said cases of violence against women had been "escalating" and police should ensure that "all culprits are brought to book".
"FIDA Kenya reiterates that violence against women is unacceptable and must not be condoned in society," she said.

But now France also has 1/11, another set of numbers etched in the annals of the terrible history of terrorism and stirring stories of people who fight back.
Nearly four million took to the streets and squares across France on Sunday 11 January for a Unity march in the wake of three days of terror that left 17 dead, and a nation saddened, stunned, and - it is hoped - strengthened in a new solidarity.
Never have so many French citizens turned out in such large numbers since the liberation of Paris from Nazi Germany in 1944.
"I'm proud of my country," reflects French journalist Nicolas Henin. "People often join protests for more jobs or higher salaries, but this wasn't for something immediate. It was for France's future."
More than a decade ago, in the wake of the shocking attacks in New York and Washington on 11 September, the slogan that sounded from many capitals was: "We're standing shoulder to shoulder."
Now there is a new version of the same refrain in the most pronounced show of solidarity since then: "Le monde se leve" (The world rises) was the Sunday morning headline in Le Journal du Dimanche.
The morning after, one word was splashed across many front pages in France - "Debout" (Standing). "The world stands with France" was the top line of the International New York Times.
Nearly 50 world leaders cleared their diaries to literally stand shoulder to shoulder again.
They marched, arms linked, along part of the route to be, and be seen to be, part of a French story of pain and resolve.
Now, more than ever, this battle is recognised as a global fight against rising extremism. But some leaders had other reasons too.

===Input Doc/Src: The book was returned after American owner Marshall Whitehead decided to track down the family of the original owner.
It was eventually handed to Donald Mackechnie, 66, at his home in Glasgow.
The Bible had originally belonged to the great-grandfather of Mr Mackechnie's grandmother.
Mr Whitehead, who was gifted the pocket-sized book in 2001 by an amateur Bible collector from Cleveland, Ohio, had rediscovered it when moving home in May.
Noting that the Bible bore the name Alexander MacDonald of Inverness with the date 1 January, 1866, he decided to track down the descendants of Mr MacDonald, who was born in 1825 and worked as a ship master, wine merchant and grocer.
After contacting Highland Council, he was put in touch with Anne Fraser, a historian at the Highland Archive Centre who created a MacDonald family tree.
Mr Whitehead then used social media to track down Mr Mackechnie's daughter Mairi in Glasgow, who alerted her Islay-raised father.
The Bible, which had a four-leaf clover tucked within its pages, was hand-delivered to Mr Mackechnie by Alistair Begg, a pastor at Mr Whitehead's church in Ohio who is originally from Glasgow and was visiting relatives in the city last month.
Mr Mackechnie, clerk to the board at St Columba Gaelic Church of Scotland in Glasgow, said: "There was a knock on the door one day and this chap was standing there.
"I almost fell on the floor when he explained what he was giving me. I could not believe it, it was such a shock and a surprise.
"The whole family are delighted and over the moon to receive his previously unheard of family heirloom.
"It does not even enter your head that this kind of thing could ever happen - it is quite amazing."
Mr Mackechnie, a retired mechanical design draftsman, said the story of the Bible's return to Scotland is "fascinating and shows there are still kind people in the world".

===Input Doc/Src: Four years ago, Veronica Boquete's winner denied Anna Signeul's side a place at the Euro 2013 finals.
But the disappointment this time round was every bit as real as Virginia Torrecilla cancelled out Emma Mitchell's opener in the dying seconds.
It kept intact Spain's unbeaten record under new head coach Jorge Vilda.
Despite the visitors enjoying the bulk of possession early on, it was Scotland who created the first real chance, Leanne Ross combining with Jane Ross before firing in a low cross that goalkeeper Dolores Gallardo managed to smother at the feet of the on-rushing Kim Little.
The visitors' best chance fell to Amanda Sampedro, but her header looped harmlessly over goalkeeper Gemma Fay's crossbar.
Jane Ross was a constant threat for Scotland, causing problems with her pace and movement, but neither team were able to create much in the way of a goalscoring opportunity.
It was no surprise then that the opening goal came from a strike from distance, Mitchell going on a powerful run from her left-back position before unleashing an unstoppable effort that Gallardo could only parry into her own net.
The goal sparked Spain into life and Alexia Putellas should have found an equaliser after a passage of intricate build-up play found her in space in the box, but the strike was well over.
Jane Ross came agonisingly close to ensuring the win late on as she connected with Mitchell's cross from the left, but Gallardo was able to get her body in the way and deny what would have been a very deserved goal for the Scotland striker.
Then came the sucker punch. With the clock ticking over to 90 minutes, Spain won a corner and Torrecilla found the touch to finally beat Fay in the Scotland goal.
Scotland, presently ranked 21st in the world, will take positives from a match where they went toe-to-toe with a top-15 ranked nation - Spain are at their highest-ever position of 14th.

===Input Doc/Src: Uncertainty over Black Friday trading, investment in online ordering, and a "challenging" first half could mean underlying full-year profit before tax is below £115m, Home Retail Group said.
In the half year to 29 August, group sales fell 2% to £2.6bn.
But underlying profit before tax increased by 10% to £34.1m.
Home Retail Group chief executive John Walden said: "While group benchmark profit before tax increased slightly during the first half, performance overall was mixed."
And he added: "At this stage of the financial year we expect the group's full-year benchmark profit before tax to be slightly below the bottom end of the current range of market expectations of £115m to £140m."
Home Retail Group shares dived almost 14% in early trading in reaction to the warning.
Mr Walden reiterated that trading at Argos over the key Christmas period was likely to be "less predictable than usual" due to the impact of Black Friday shopping deals.
Originating in the US, Black Friday is becoming a major day for UK retailers. Last year, police were called in a number of UK cities amid frenzied buying from shoppers.
Analysts said Black Friday offers caused a shift in spending patterns in the final quarter of last year, which may have had a negative impact on Christmas shopping.
Mr Walden said Home Retail Group had increased investment in "Fast Track", Argos' online ordering, delivery, and click-and-collect service.
The service, which was announced last week, offers a same-day delivery service across the UK, seven days a week.
Home Retail Group is in the process of trying to transform Argos from a catalogue-based retailer into a more digital business.
However, Mr Walden said that Argos had a "challenging first half", with like-for-like sales down 3.4%. The chain suffered from weak sales of TVs and tablet computers.
But Homebase like-for-like sales rose 5.6%, with Hygena kitchens, Ideal Standards bathrooms and Habitat furniture sales growing.

It was not revealed how much money would be invested.
Besides the government investment, Premier Li Keqiang also urged telecoms companies to cut their prices and up their speeds, according to China's cabinet the State Council.
He also said they should cut data roaming charges for Chinese tourists, although he acknowledged that it was ultimately for the market to decide.
He did, however, announce a round of investment infrastructure improvements to the same end.
"China has more cell-phone users than any other country, but its internet service speed ranks below 80th in the world due to underdeveloped information infrastructure," the premier said, according to a release from the State Council.
He added that "speeding up the construction of information infrastructure will boost investment and support" in China, as well as helping "mass innovation".
Telecoms firms should make rapid moves to cut prices and increase urban broadband speeds by around 40%, according to Mr Li.
China's investment in broadband could benefit global network equipment makers such as Ericsson and Nokia Oyj's Alcatel-Lucent, as well as home-grown players like Huawei Technologies and ZTE.
Mr Li did not say how much investment would be needed, but officials have previously earmarked around 2tn yuan ($322bn, Â£204bn) to improve China's broadband infrastructure by 2020.

===Input Doc/Src: Supt David Borrie, of Northumbria Police, is said to have simply been told "don't apply for promotion" by his chief constable, Mike Craik.
Mr Craik has been at the centre of allegations about officers' conduct.
The claim was made at a tribunal brought by the force's former head of legal services.
Denise Aubrey, 54, was sacked in 2014 for gross misconduct after allegedly disclosing information about an affair Mr Craik was said to be having with his assistant chief constable, Carolyn Peacock, and a second relationship between two further high-ranking officers.
Mr Aubrey denies she did so and is claiming unfair dismissal, sexual and disability discrimination, victimisation and harassment.
In her witness statement, she said Mr Borrie, who is now 57 and retired from the force, pursued the "extremely vulnerable" civilian member of staff, who cannot be named for legal reasons, and "groped her in the office".
She said: "On another occasion, he took her for a drink in the afternoon at a pub and then pressurised her into giving him oral sex."
This happened a second time and eventually an investigation was launched, the tribunal in North Shields heard.
Ms Aubrey said: "Whilst it was felt that a criminal charge would not succeed, he had clearly breached police standards.
"Instead, it was decided to move him but to allow him to complete his service so that he could get his pension. Mr Craik decided to have a 'quiet word' with him and told him 'not to bother applying for promotion'.
"However, the IPCC [the police watchdog] insisted that he received a formal written warning."
Earlier in the week, the tribunal was told Mrs Peacock's husband, who was also a policeman, punched Mr Craik at a barbecue after learning of the affair.
Officers were called to deal with the altercation, but the record of the incident was then said to be deleted - leading to an allegation of a "cover-up" by Ms Aubrey's QC, Daphne Romney.
Rumours of the relationship began circulating in 2007, Ms Aubrey said.

Writers unanimously called it for Mrs Clinton, saying Mr Trump had "bombed on the ultimate reality show" and "did not appear ready to be president".
Stephen Stromberg mused on what a debate victory for Mrs Clinton actually meant.
"If Americans were so evenly split heading into Monday night, after the monstrous campaign Trump had run before the debate, they may be capable of anything," he wrote.
Fox News
Pundits consulted by the broadcaster said Mr Trump had "struggled", "never took control" and "failed to exploit" the issue around Mrs Clinton's emails.
"It helps to be prepared," said Douglas Schoen, declaring victory for Mrs Clinton.
"On so many fronts he should have been able to wipe that smug grin off Hillary's face; he did not rise to the challenge," said Liz Peek.

Its panel of three commentators had Mrs Clinton winning every round.
"Politics is harder than it seems, and Trump found that out tonight," said Cathleen Decker. "Clinton was unflappable... and probably likeable enough," said Doyle McManus.
David Lauter said Mr Trump's lack of preparation echoed the "terrible job" President Obama did in the first TV debate four years ago. "But remember that Obama bounced back," he said.

===Input Doc/Src: The Police Reform and Social Responsibility Bill creates police commissioners and changes the balance of power with chief constables.
At the heart of the government's proposals is a complete overhaul of the local control of police forces.
There are 43 forces for England and Wales and the government says it won't be merging them.
Instead, it says it wants to strengthen local democratic control by creating Police and Crime Commissioners for each force.
The commissioner will be directly elected and will hold the chief constable to account - meaning they will be able to hire and fire chief constables.
According to the legislation, the commissioner's basic duties will be to publish a "police and crime plan", set local police and crime objectives and the budget. The commissioner will also set the amount of the "precept" that their local electors have to pay, the part of police funding collected through the council tax.
The chief constable will appoint all other officers and will "retain responsibility for the direction and control of the police force".
The police commissioner takes over the responsibilities of the current police authorities - but they will have the additional power of being able to sack a chief constable. Under the current system, chiefs are appointed by the force's police authority in consultation with the Home Office.
Each force in England and Wales outside of London will elect a police commissioner in May 2012. The commissioners will be able to hold office for two terms.
London is being treated differently because the Metropolitan Police Commissioner is Britain's top police officer with national duties including co-ordinating counter-terrorism. The Metropolitan Police Commissioner is appointed directly by the Home Secretary who has to take the view of the Mayor of London into account.
Police Authorities will be scrapped. Instead, they will be replaced by a new body called a policing and crime panel. Police authorities oversee the budget and workings of

===Input Doc/Src: In saying that, you may think I've gone mad - given that the Smith Commission has apparently made some huge decisions.
Here is what stands out for me from today's announcement.
1) The Scottish parliament will have total control over income tax rates and the thresholds at which they kick in (but Westminster will still set the tax-free allowance).
2) Revenue raised from the first 10 percentage points of VAT on Scottish spending will be allotted to the Scottish government.
3) The Scottish parliament will have power both to create new benefits and vary some planned and existing benefits - including the housing cost element of Universal Credit, benefits for carers and the disabled, and cold weather related payments.
There are lots of other important new powers being transferred to Holyrood, including the ability to lower the voting age, change speed limits, license frackers, influence the new BBC Charter, and - possibly - change abortion rules.
But it is the transfer of big tax and spending powers that creates significant fiscal and economic uncertainties - whose resolution may have serious political consequences.
The lynchpin of all this is what the Commission calls the fiscal framework for the new devolution, which includes a number of principles.
Perhaps the most important is that at the precise moment that the new powers are devolved, Scotland's budget and the UK's budget should neither be bigger or smaller as a result of this transfer to Holyrood of new spending and taxing powers.
Or to put it another way, the block grant paid to Scotland under the Barnett formula should be reduced to account for taxes devolved to Scotland and increased to account for spending transferred to Scotland - and future payments under the new Barnett formula should be indexed to protect their real value.
Or to put it another way, neither Scots taxpayers or those in the rest of the UK should suffer detriment as a direct result of the new devolution.
Which is all very well to say, but my goo

===Input Doc/Src: Philip Garvey, 56, his wife Ann, 55, and their children Emily, 23, and Daniel, 20, died when their plane came down in Somerset in November 2015.
They were flying from Surrey to Devon.
The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) said it was possible Mr Garvey tried to manually start landing while the autopilot was still on.
Mr Garvey had taken off from Fairoakes Airport, close to the family home in Woking, and was heading to Dunkeswell Aerodrome.
The AAIB's report said it was an overcast and rainy day and all planned flights at Dunkeswell had been cancelled because of the weather.
Several witnesses told investigators they heard a sound like a plane doing "aerobatics" before the Piper Malibu Mirage appeared from the clouds and hit the ground near Churchinford, south of Taunton.
The AAIB said: "The evidence from the autopilot examination system suggested that, as the pilot turned on to the final approach and started to descend, the autopilot may not have been disengaged due to a mental lapse, incorrect button selection or a technical fault."
The plane was seen to quickly climb into cloud before coming down.
The AAIB concluded it was "unable to determine with certainty the reason for the initial rapid climb" but said attempting to override the autopilot would have caused the plane to go "nose up" as it would fight to maintain its set height.
While the aircraft could still have been controllable, it said "recovery may have been beyond his capabilities".
Mr Garvey had been a pilot since 2012 and had flown to Dunkeswell 25 times since 2013, including 14 times from Fairoaks.
His instructors told investigators he was "less able than average pilots at multi-tasking and poor at prioritising especially when under pressure".
Another instructor said Mr Garvey "would often have difficulty dealing with an unusual or unexpected condition".
---Sum/Tgt: A pilot who died along with his family when the plane he was flying crashed was "poor under pressure", his instructors have told investigators.

===Input Doc/Src: The star will be honoured for his contribution to music, as well as his acting and humanitarian work.
His catalogue includes hits such as Every Breath You Take, Fields of Gold and Don't Stand So Close To Me.
"Sting is an icon in the truest sense of the word," said Brandon Bakshi of the BMI, a music rights organisation.
"His musical catalogue has had an enormous impact on music lovers from around the globe across multiple generations."
When the former Police frontman won the outstanding contribution award at the Brit Awards in 2002, he said: "I've had a very, very long career in music.
"If I have gleaned any wisdom, it's encapsulated in five words: 'Music is its own reward.'"
He has also won 16 Grammys and been inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He is due to release a new album, 57th & 9th, in November.
The BMI - whose full name is Broadcast Music, Inc - keeps track of the songs played on radio and television and collects royalties on behalf of writers and publishers.
Now in their 65th year, the BMI London Awards honour the writers and publishers of the most-performed British pop songs during the past 12 months.
Last year, the US version of the ceremony saw Taylor Swift win a Taylor Swift Award - created in the star's name to recognise her domination of the airwaves in 2015.
Swift told the audience: "If they had chosen someone else to give the Taylor Swift Award to, I'd be kind of bummed about it."

===Input Doc/Src: John Lowe, who killed Christine Lee and Lucy Lee in February, was given a minimum sentence of 25 years.
The jury at his Guildford Crown Court trial was told Lowe wanted the women "put down".
Surrey Police has apologised for returning Lowe's confiscated guns to him seven months before the shooting.
Sentencing Lowe, Mr Justice Singh praised the "extraordinary courage" of Lucy Lee after she returned to face her killer after making a frantic 999 call.
He said that, having heard the evidence, he had come to the "clear conclusion" the 82-year-old had intended to kill both of the women.
"You shot Lucy Lee in the back of her head after she made the 999 call, then reloaded your gun and pursued her outside the cottage, with the intention of making sure that this time she died," he said.
In a victim impact statement Stacy Banner, Lucy Lee's sister, said she was "haunted by what Lowe has done".
She said Lucy was the "big sister who comforted and preceded me" and the murders had left her struggling to eat and sleep.
Outside court, she said: "I'm relieved it's over. He's never getting out."
Ms Banner has criticised police for returning guns to Lowe just months before he carried out the shootings.
Surrey Police has admitted the decision "was flawed and did not meet national standards".
Three Surrey Police employees are being investigated for gross misconduct by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) over the decision to return the weapons.
Christine Lee's sister, Julia James, said she felt "despair, physically and emotionally" since the death of her two relatives.
"I miss them more than I can say," she said.
At the start of the hearing, prosecutor Mark Dennis QC said Lowe's advanced age should not "dramatically" reduce his sentence and the "starting point" for a double murder of this kind would be a minimum of 30 years in jail.
Surrey's Police and Crime Commissioner Kevin Hurley said as the trial was now over the inquiry could focus on why Lowe was given back his guns

===Input Doc/Src: In addition to the ban for single women, married women can only freeze their eggs in specific circumstances - for instance when they are to undergo chemotherapy, state media say.
The ban is not new but caught attention after news that actress Xu Jinglei had gone to the US to have her eggs frozen.
Many have ridiculed the ban and described it as sexist.
The debate began in July, after Xu Jinglei, 41, said that she had frozen her ova, or egg cells, in the US in 2013.
The 41-year-old, who is considered one of China's "Big Four" actresses, said she had taken the decision because she might want children in the future.
Then on Sunday, state-run broadcaster CCTV ran a report on the subject, which highlighted some of the risks associated with the procedure and said the ban was "in accordance with family planning policies".
The report triggered a barrage of criticism on Chinese social media, with close to 33,000 comments on CCTV's weibo (microblog) thread alone, and more than 11 million views for hashtags related to the subject.
"We don't even have control over own own ovaries anymore!" user "Kitty is a Lace Lover" wrote.
"Its meaning is that unmarried women don't have the right to reproduce," user Fish girl wrote.
Many questioned why China allowed male sperm donors, but prevented women from freezing their eggs, while others mocked the ban as an attempt to force more women to marry and have children in a hurry.
"This ban should help the men that no one wants!" one user wrote.
There are fewer limitations on the storage of sperm in China.
State media say the restrictions are designed to combat a black market in human eggs, and have stressed the possible health risks associated with the procedure.
China introduced its one-child policy at the end of the 1970s to curb rapid population growth - but eased the policy in 2013 amid concerns over the country's ageing population.

===Input Doc/Src: A senior official at the Tunisian interior ministry told the Associated Press that Rezgui had been in Libya in January, the same time as two men who attacked a Tunisian museum in March.
Most of the dead in Sousse were foreign tourists, including 30 Britons.
The Islamic State group (IS) has claimed the attack as its own.
"The attacker trained in Libya with weapons at the same period as the Bardo [museum] attackers," Rafik Chelli from the interior ministry told AP.
IS also said it was behind the Bardo museum attack in Tunis that left 22 people dead.
Mr Chelli said that Rezgui had travelled to the Libyan town of Sabratha at the same time as the Bardo attackers.
"He crossed the borders secretly," Mr Chielli told AP.
IS has a significant presence in Libya, Tunisia's eastern neighbour, and is thought to control the major towns of Derna and Sirte.
The Tunisian authorities have released photos of two suspects, Bin Abdallah and Rafkhe Talari - friends of Rezgui that the police have yet to locate.
Rezgui, 23, was radicalised while studying engineering.
The Tunisian authorities have already arrested several suspected accomplices.
However, Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi has admitted that the security services were not prepared for an attack of this kind.
He said extra security had been put in place at other locations during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, but nobody had expected beaches to be a target.
The UK Foreign Office has updated its travel advice to warn that further terrorist attacks in Tunisia are possible, and has urged people to be vigilant.
Tour companies have laid on extra flights and about 10,000 British tourists have flown home from Tunisia since Friday, according to the Association of British Travel Agents.
The repatriation of bodies of Britons killed in the attack will begin on Wednesday, Downing Street has said.
Twenty-one Britons have been identified as victims, with nine more believed to be among the dead, it added.

===Input Doc/Src: Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson said it was a great deal for taxpayers, with the club paying about Â£4.4m per year in return for the council's support.
But the city's Liberal Democrat leader Richard Kemp asked why a club largely owned by "billionaire" businessman Farhad Moshiri needed council backing.
He asked: "What are the safeguards?"
The council cabinet has agreed to set up a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to help Everton secure the investment it needs to build a new 50,000 capacity ground at Bramley-Moore Dock on the banks of the Mersey.
Everton last week announced a deal to acquire the land needed for the project.
The local authority said its agreement with Everton includes measures to ensure it will always be paid by the football club.
"It is not just a good deal for the council in terms of receiving funding but equally it is going to be the driver for regeneration for north Liverpool," said Mr Anderson.
"From my point of view, it is job done."
Mr Kemp said he still has his doubts.
"I am not against the deal itself but I want to know what the safeguards are. I want to know the direct benefit for the council.
"Why do billionaires need a guarantee from a third party? In fact why do they need a loan at all?"
Mr Anderson said he had had several meetings with Iranian businessman Mr Moshiri, who bought a 49.9% share in the Premier League club last year.
"We're not funding a billionaire - we are actually doing a great deal for Liverpool City Council," said Mr Anderson.
"I am not here to browbeat Everton into starting but... I certainly want them to crack on because if we get chosen for the Commonwealth Games in 2022 we will need to deliver."
Prof Tom Cannon, emeritus professor at the University of Liverpool's School of Management, said the stadium would bring direct benefits to the city and the council.
"The economic benefit is development of another strong economic agent in a growth area like sport and it reinforces the city's burgeoning strength as a leading centre fo

A third penalty edged Falcons further ahead before Will Welch was sin-binned as Worcester grabbed a penalty try.
Wynand Olivier's score edged Worcester ahead, but Tongan scrum-half Takulua converted his own try to seal victory.
The win does enough to mathematically keep Falcons in contention for a place in European club rugby's top competition for the first time in 12 years, as the team finishing seventh in the table earn the chance to qualify through the play-offs.
However, a win for Northampton at Exeter on Saturday ends all hopes, which also come with other permutations outside their final league standing.
Falcons' aspirations were under real threat throughout at Kingston Park, with Worcester seeing a number of good chances go begging before the break, the best of which saw Perry Humphreys knock-on close to the line.
A penalty try from a maul, which also saw Newcastle's Welch yellow-carded, was their first response after going 9-0 down.
Olivier's try edged the visitors ahead for the first time, with both sides momentarily a man down soon after as Will Spencer was sin-binned for the hosts.
And as Worcester closed in for their first away league win for 13 months, Takulua dived over and kept his cool when adding the extra two points to cap a fine individual display.
Newcastle: Watson; Goneva, C Harris, Socino, Sinoti; Hodgson, Takulua; Vickers, Lawson, Welsh, Green, Robinson, M Wilson, Welch (capt), Chick.

The incident prompted the prisons minister to respond to an urgent question in the House of Commons.
Andrew Selous told a debate they are "reviewing prison service instruction".

Tim Farron, Lib Dem leader, tweeted: "We must reform the law urgently."
Cat Smith, shadow minister for women and equalities, asked if the policy guidelines for transgender prisoners were adequate, and if they are being properly applied.
Mr Selous responded: "Her death like all others in custody is a tragedy and we are totally committed to reducing the number of deaths in prisons.
"We believe that Vikki Thompson was being looked after in accordance with the relevant procedures, but that is now a matter for the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman and Coroner."
He said a review of the policy relating to the care of transgender prisoners had begun earlier this year, and revised policy guidance will be issued and implemented "in due course".
It is estimated there are around 80 transgender prisoners in the UK, although the Ministry of Justice does not keep precise figures.
The debate also follows a transgender woman being sent to a men's prison in Bristol.

===Input Doc/Src: Ivor Miller, 27, who has learning difficulties, was chased by the group after one member called him "a beast".
The 27-year-old sought refuge in a derelict flat and jumped out a second floor window suffering severe injury.
At the High Court in Glasgow, judge Norman Ritchie QC ordered a 17-year-old man to be detained for six months.
The judge told the eight accused: "This whole incident, some of which was captured on CCTV, is extremely disturbing.
"The group, like a pack of animals, turned on an entirely innocent young man for no good reason other than he behaved differently because he has learning difficulties."
Three of those who pursued Mr Miller were originally charged with attempted murder.
Michael Clare, 21, from Airdrie, North Lanarkshire, and two 17-year-old youths, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had their guilty pleas to charges of assault accepted.
All three admitted attacking Mr Miller by chasing him into the common close at 52 Howard Street, Glasgow, on 4 August last year.
All three, and another 17-year-old youth, a 16-year-old girl, a 16-year-old youth and 23-year-old David Newlands, from Maryhill, Glasgow, admitted committing a breach of the peace and placing Mr Miller in a state of fear and alarm.
Newlands also pleaded guilty to punching Mr Miller on the head in the Hootenanny pub in Howard Street.
Jade Park, 19, from Glasgow, who sparked the incident by falsely calling Mr Miller "a beast" admitted punching him in Jamaica Street and in the Crystal Palace pub.
Judge Ritchie sentenced a 17-year-old male to six months detention for assault.
He deferred sentence on Park, who is about to give birth, until June for good behaviour and imposed a community payback order on all the others and ordered then to perform 150 hours unpaid work in the community.

===Input Doc/Src: The strikes by RMT, Aslef and Unite union members will start on the evenings of 26 January, 15 February and 17 February.
RMT General Secretary Mick Cash said the plans to introduce a Night Tube were "bodged".
London Underground called the unions' position "absurd".
It has offered a four-year pay deal over the issue and said it would hire part-time drivers to staff an all-night service at weekends.
More on this and other London stories.
Aslef claimed earlier London Underground management had refused to meet to discuss conditions for working on the proposed Night Tube.
The union's London district organiser, Finn Brennan, said: "We genuinely regret the inconvenience that will be caused but the behaviour of London Underground's senior management team have left us with no other choice.
Steve Griffiths, LU's chief operating officer, responded: "The unions' position is absurd and detached from the real world."
He added: "The truth is that they expect our customers to pay for their excessive demands for even more money, fewer hours and a four-day week."
"No employer could allow this and strike action will change nothing. There is no more money."
The Night Tube, which was due to begin in September, will see 24-hour services on five lines on Fridays and Saturdays.
Tube drivers are also unhappy with pay and station rosters, according to BBC London transport correspondent Tom Edwards.
RMT general secretary Mick Cash said the union supported the principle of a "properly worked-out night Tube service" but said an "abject failure to work through the detail has led to a comprehensive breakdown in the negotiations".
London Mayor Boris Johnson said: "If a strike goes ahead, it will hit many London Underground workers who do not necessarily support the action, and it will cost the strikers in lost pay."
But Labour mayoral candidate Sadiq Khan said Mr Johnson was to blame, arguing: "It proves once and for all that the Tory strategy of refusing to negotiate or even meet with the unions

Bolasie added a second soon afterwards as he poked the ball past Costel Pantilimon after Murray's knockdown.
A lofted finish from Bolasie made it 3-0 and he completed his treble from Murray's pass before Connor Wickham volleyed in a late consolation.
The result, the second time in three home games that Sunderland have conceded four goals, increases the Black Cats' relegation fears.

They have been in the Premier League for eight successive seasons but are now 16th in the table, only three points above QPR and Burnley.
Sunderland have only six games left to save themselves, but their last two matches of the season are away at Arsenal and then at current leaders Chelsea.
Dick Advocaat, brought in after former manager Gus Poyet had been sacked following a 4-0 home defeat by Aston Villa, had stressed the importance of this match to his side.
But he was let down by some woeful defending as the hosts capitulated and conceded four goals in a 14-minute spell early in the second half.
After a quiet first half that was low on quality and goalscoring chances, but high on fierce challenges, the match sprung into life within three minutes of the restart.
Murray headed in his sixth goal in six games to set Palace on their way to their eighth win in 12 Premier League games since Alan Pardew took over at the start of the January.
But even he could not have expected what was to follow.
The hosts fell apart and three minutes later Bolasie, with one goal in his previous 27 league matches this season, got to Murray's flick-on first to make it 2-0.

===Input Doc/Src: Researchers assessing the results of nearly 200 studies say sperm counts among men from North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, seem to have halved in less than 40 years.
Some experts are sceptical of the Human Reproduction Update findings.
But lead researcher Dr Hagai Levine said he was "very worried" about what might happen in the future.
The assessment, one of the largest ever undertaken, brings together the results of 185 studies between 1973 and 2011.
Dr Levine, an epidemiologist, told the BBC that if the trend continued humans would become extinct.
"If we will not change the ways that we are living and the environment and the chemicals that we are exposed to, I am very worried about what will happen in the future," he said.
"Eventually we may have a problem, and with reproduction in general, and it may be the extinction of the human species."
Scientists not involved in the study have praised the quality of the research but say that it may be premature to come to such a conclusion.
Dr Levine, from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, found a 52.4% decline in sperm concentration, and a 59.3% decline in total sperm count in men from North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand.
The study also indicates the rate of decline among men living in these countries is continuing and possibly even increasing.
In contrast, no significant decline was seen in South America, Asia and Africa, but the researchers point out that far fewer studies have been conducted on these continents. However, Dr Levine is concerned that eventually sperm counts could fall in these places too.
Many previous studies have indicated similar sharp declines in sperm count in developed economies, but sceptics say that a large proportion of them have been flawed.
Some have investigated a relatively small number of men, or included only men who attend fertility clinics and are, in any case, more likely to have low sperm counts.
There is also concern that studies that claim to show a decli

It had been delivering about 3m letters every week in the three cities, in direct competition with Royal Mail.
The private equity arm of Lloyds bank decided not to invest, triggering a review.
Parent group PostNL said the firm had begun a consultation with affected staff "to minimise the impact of the decision".
The company also pointed out it would continue to collect 80m items a week to be fed into the Royal Mail system for final delivery.
A statement released by PostNL said: "Following the termination of the discussions on the proposed investment in Whistl UK to fund the further rollout of its current end-to-end (E2E) activities, we have assessed alternative scenarios for Whistl's E2E operations.
"Further to this assessment, it has been decided to end Whistl's E2E operations.
"Whistl remains committed to further developing its successful activities in the UK, including downstream access (DSA) service, door-drop media, packets and parcels and logistics."
About 1,800 workers were employed by Whistl, with many on zero-hours contracts.

===Input Doc/Src: Dionisio Vilca set off on his search, protesting that the authorities had abandoned efforts to find his police officer son Cesar.
Cesar Vilca had been missing for 20 days, after his unit came under attack by rebels in the southern Cusco region.
Another officer, Luis Astuquillca, was shot in the leg but walked for 17 days through the rainforest to safety.
With the help of two local people who had spotted Cesar's body, Mr Vilca set off to recover his remains.
Travelling in a pick-up truck, the group reached the spot and took the police officer's corpse back to the nearest community.
Mr Vilca had complained that the authorities had wound down their efforts to locate Cesar.
But the interior ministry noted that there had been "an intense and prolonged search"  that had cost the lives of three members of the security forces.
Cesar Vilca and his unit were deployed on 12 April to search for a group of 36 gas workers abducted by Shining Path rebels.
They came under fire from the guerrillas and four officers were killed.
The hostages were released by their captors six days after being abducted in a remote region close to the Ene-Apurimac valley - one of the last strongholds of the Shining Path.
The Shining Path posed a major challenge to the Peruvian state in the 1980s and early 1990s, but is now reduced to small gangs involved in cocaine trafficking.

===Input Doc/Src: They believe a Canadian lynx was prowling around the fields of the South West in 1903 before being shot after attacking two dogs in Devon.
Tests on the animal revealed it had probably spent some time in captivity before escaping or being set free.
The animal had been donated to Bristol Museum at the time of its death and kept in its stores for decades.
The scientists' findings are published in the journal Historical Biology.
Dr Ross Barnett, a molecular biologist from the University of Copenhagen and the University of Durham, said:  "I've seen one of these cats in the wild.
"They are pretty impressive cats - they are a reasonable size, and they have lots of fluffy fur which makes them look even bigger. They have sharp claws, teeth and strong muscles."
From blurry photos of the Beast of Bodmin Moor in Cornwall, to reports of a lion on the loose in Essex in 2012, the UK has a long tradition of spotting big cats.
Most of these claims are dismissed as misidentifications, hoaxes or even hallucinations, but not in this case.
In 1903, the unusual cat was donated to the Bristol Museum and Art Gallery. The museum's records state that it had been shot after attacking and killing two dogs close to Newton Abbot in Devon.
Unsure of exactly what it was, the exotic beast was stuffed, its skeleton preserved, and then the remains were tucked away in the museum's stores.
More than a century later, the cat was unearthed by a scientist who thought the find might be significant.
An analysis of the skeleton and mounted skin revealed that the animal was a Canadian lynx, which is about two to three times the size of a domestic cat and is usually found in Canada and the northern states of the US.
The researchers found that the animal's teeth were badly decayed.
Dr Barnett said:  "We think it had probably been in captivity at some point in its life.
"It had lost all of its incisors, which would have been a pretty debilitating injury for a wild cat, but not a problem for one in captivity.

Hull Crown Court heard the two men had fallen out after Mr Wilson, also 19, began a relationship with Bigley's mother.
Bigley, of Wadsley Lane, Sheffield, was told he must serve at least 22 years in jail.
More stories from across South Yorkshire
Hull Crown Court heard Bigley was still wearing his heavily blood-soaked clothing and attempting to wash the blood from his hands when was arrested in the early hours of 28 May.
Det Ch Insp Craig Jackson said: "This was a violent and brutal attack on Matthew, a young man whom Bigley once considered his friend.
"The court heard how both he and the victim knew each other for many years, but their friendship broke down after Matthew began a romantic relationship with Bigley's mother.
"His anger and frustration came to the fore in the early hours of that morning in May and a young man who had everything to live for has now tragically lost his life."
Mr Wilson's family said in a statement they were "satisfied" with the jury's verdict.
However, they added: "While we regard the sentence Bigley has been given as fair, no sentence will ever bring Matt back to us.
"We too have been handed a life sentence."

Ms Abdhou, known as Montana, was approached by "two males" on bicycles who fired "shots at her group of friends".
Police said nothing in her background gave "any suggestion she would have been a target" in the shooting, which took place on Friday, 26 May.
CCTV images of the men believed to have carried out the shooting have also been released.
Footage shows the two suspects at 20.53 BST cycling along Malvern Place, seconds before turning into Malvern Road where the shooting took place, police said.
They are described as being of slim to medium build, both wearing dark clothing and concealing their appearance through the use of face coverings.
A 21-year-old man who was arrested at the scene on the night of the attack has been released under investigation pending further enquiries.
A 19-year-old man and a man, aged 20, were arrested in west London on suspicion of murder in the early hours of 31 May. They have been bailed pending further enquiries.

"These individuals should not be shielded by friends or family, or supported in any way.
"No right-minded person would want those responsible for depriving Mohanna's family from ever seeing her again, to evade capture.

===Input Doc/Src: Oscar Munoz said he felt "shame and embarrassment" and vowed it would never happen again to a seated passenger on one of United's aircraft.
The embattled aviation boss said the passenger in question, David Dao, deserved "certainly an apology".
Mr Munoz initially described Mr Dao as "disruptive and belligerent".
United Airline's public relations disaster
Why do airlines overbook?
"That shame and embarrassment was pretty palpable for me and for a lot of our family," the contrite chief executive told ABC's Good Morning America programme.
An online petition calling for Mr Munoz to resign had gained more than 60,000 signatures by Wednesday afternoon.
But when asked if he would stand down, he said: "No. I was hired to make United better and we've been doing that and that's what I'll continue to do."
Mr Dao was pulled off Sunday evening's flight from Chicago to Louisville, Kentucky, because the flight was fully booked, and the airline wanted to get four passengers to leave to make room for four staff members.
Mr Dao was left bloodied after law enforcement officials dragged him off the plane as he refused to leave.
The footage provoked international outrage and the Dao family issued a statement on Tuesday evening expressing gratitude for the "outpouring of support".
"This can never, will never happen again on a United Airlines flight," said Mr Munoz in Wednesday morning's television interview.
He was asked what the company would do in future if a seated passenger refused voluntarily to leave an overbooked plane based on the airline's compensation offer.
"We're not going to put a law enforcement official to take them off," he said. "To remove a booked, paid seated passenger, we can't do that."
Mr Munoz was asked if Mr Dao, who has been undergoing treatment at a Chicago hospital, was at fault.
The chief executive paused.
He said: "No. He can't be. He was a paying passenger sitting on our seat in our aircraft and no one should be treated that way. Period."

===Input Doc/Src: New Zealanders living in Australia for at least five years can apply if they earn the median wage or more, and pass security, character and health checks.
The "new pathway" means easier access to citizenship, which allows access to a range of welfare services.
The deal follows tensions over the deportation of New Zealand criminals under laws introduced last year.
These laws allow Australia to deport any foreigners sentenced to more than 12 months in jail.
Prime Minister Key previously said the issue was "undermining [a] special relationship".
"We traversed some of the concerns that we continue to have," he said in Sydney on Friday. "We appreciate the work that  [Australia has] been doing around ensuring that people can appeal those decisions."
Meanwhile, Mr Key formally extended the offer to take in some of the 267 asylum seekers awaiting deportation to Australia's offshore detention centre in Nauru.
"All I can simply say is the offer remains on the table," Mr Key said.
The Australian government is refusing to alter its border security policy, saying it is aimed at stopping the people smuggling trade.

===Input Doc/Src: US President Donald Trump's two adult sons, Donald Jr and Eric, were at the luxury hotel's grand opening.
About 200 protesters gathered outside the building to chant "dump Trump" before the noon ceremony.
The city's mayor and city council boycotted the event because of the president's controversial statements about immigrants.
Steel fences surrounded the downtown property early Tuesday ahead of the ceremony, but that didn't stop the demonstrations.
The words "hate lives here" were scrawled in chalk outside the CA$360m ($274m/Â£220m) luxury hotel, and people stuck anti-Trump sticky notes to the outside of the building.
Another protest was scheduled to take place in downtown Vancouver for 1600 local time (midnight GMT).
In a statement, the Vancouver police force said the safety of both those attending the event and the general public was a priority. They received help from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Protective Policing unit, which is responsible for the safety of "Internationally Protected Persons," such as the family of foreign officials.
A spokesperson for the RCMP declined to say how much security cost.
The  Canadian tower was designed by famed architect Arthur Erickson and had a soft launch last month. The building has a distinctive 45-degree twist as it rises upward and is the second-tallest building on the city's skyline.
Mr Trump's sons and his daughter Tiffany bypassed protestors by entering through the back, local media reported.
In a press conference in the hotel's grand ballroom, Eric Trump praised developer Joo Kim Tiah's efforts in getting the hotel and condominium project built.
"We love you, we love the relationship and we're going to have a lot of fun for many years to come," said Eric Trump.

===Input Doc/Src: It will feature in Sunday's first episode of the new series of the long-running programme, which was recorded at Tewkesbury Abbey in Gloucestershire.
Expert Fergus Gambon said it was "unique" and "one of the most important English baby houses in existence".
The doll's house was built in 1705 and is extremely well preserved.
In a first for the programme, a camera crew went to film at the home of the object's owner, after just a few dolls were taken to the recording, which took place in May.
Mr Gambon, who is the son of actor Sir Michael Gambon, said: "As soon as I saw the dolls I recognised the importance of it.
"And it is quite a large object, it's extraordinarily fragile, it's not something that you can just shove in the back of the car and bring over.
"So if we wanted to show the viewers what the house was like, this was really our only chance."
The doll's house is well preserved, with the dolls in their original clothes, and was made on the Isle of Dogs for a Miss E Westbrook.
It has been in the owner's family ever since, being passed down the female line for generations.
Mr Gambon said he had known of the existence of the doll's house after having seen photographs of it in a book from the 1950s.
"I saw the dolls first and I recognised them immediately from the pictures," he said.
"The extraordinary thing about the Westbrook is the fact that it's remained in the family since it was made, and it is essentially a little time capsule."

===Input Doc/Src: Warburton wants to use the spur of helping Blues qualify for Europe to secure his spot on the three-Test tour in June.
Four successive wins have put the Blues just a point outside the Pro12 top six.
"That is how I approach it, making it show that I am worthy of a place in the Welsh team," Warburton told BBC Wales.
The eighth-placed Blues have two games remaining, starting with the Judgement Day showdown with Ospreys on 30 April at the Principality Stadium.
They then visit direct rivals Edinburgh, currently sixth and a place ahead of Muster, on the final day of the campaign on 7 May.
"I have felt like the last two games for the Blues have been a trial for Wales if I am honest, there are some pretty big personal battles all across the field," Warburton said.
"You get a lot of respect for performing well in Welsh derbies, individually and as a team and for me personally, I have felt the need to prove myself all over again in a Blues shirt after the Six Nations.
"I still feel I have a point to prove when it comes to Welsh selection because I want to make sure you can go into the New Zealand tour, hopefully having your hand held up as one of the form players."
Dual contract star Warburton says a return to his beloved Blues has been the perfect way to get over Wales failing to win the Six Nations.
"I still felt I was chasing a little bit of match fitness. I was disappointed with the way the Six Nations went," he said,
"I did okay, but didn't do as well as I would have wanted and I really felt like I owed the Blues some big performances.
"Because I'd had two-and-a-half games after the World Cup and before the Six Nations, which isn't enough really and I just wanted to play a lot more rugby than that for the Blues.

Their mummified bodies were kept in a basement flat in the city's Gilmore Place, which was regularly visited by a son of the couple, until 2002.
Since their discovery, the bodies have been stored in the city's mortuary.
Edinburgh city council has been trying to get the family's consent to bury Mr and Mrs Marcel, but this has been repeatedly refused.
Now, almost 30 years after Mrs Marcel died, the council has lodged a petition at the Court of Session to seek permission to dispose of their bodies.
Prof Roderick Paisley from Aberdeen University's Law School said: "The wheels of justice do grind slowly, and they appear to be grinding incredibly slowly on this particular hearse.
"I think this should have been dealt with three or four years ago.
"I do appreciate there are sensitivities here, but the law is reasonably clear."
A police investigation was carried out when the bodies were found in 2002, but no charges were brought.
Death certificates had been correctly issued and the pair had died of natural causes.

===Input Doc/Src: The man in charge of this is Yaakov Asulin. Every day he, along with at least two other supervisors, makes sure that the chefs and restaurant staff keep to meticulous standards when it comes to keeping kosher.
But he is not employed by the hotel. His boss instead is the Chief Rabbinate of Israel, the supreme religious body of Israel in charge of ruling over all religious matters including weddings and divorce.
"His job is very hard because he has to maintain all the workers and he has to check that everything is in place and on time and by the strict rules of kashrut," says Lannon Polon, the manager of Ramat Rachel Hotel.
"You can't mix cutlery, you can't mix certain products, of course we don't cook with milk and meat - most of the tourists, it's quite difficult for them.
"Most people in the world don't care, they eat meat and milk together and cheeseburger and ice-cream with steaks. We're conservative here."
The hotel pays the supervisors directly and it costs the hotel around 23,000 Israeli shekels ($6,100; Â£4,600) a month to employ them.
While keeping kosher is a religious issue, it has also become a contentious economic and political concern in Israel, with some restaurateurs saying the religious authorities are exerting too much power over business.
Rabbi Aaron Lebowitz founded the Alternative Kosher Supervision Project. They also have inspectors but say they offer better service at a fraction of the cost.
"Over the years in Israel, the monopoly that the Chief Rabbinate has, has bred corruption at worst and even at best there's no competition," he says.
"Because there's no competition, the quality of service, the quality of supervision and also the cost are not competitive and are not of high quality.

The Coroner for Cornwall concluded the cause of death was "natural causes contributed by psycho-social factors".
Summing up, Dr Emma Carlyon said it could have been prevented.
"Something went wrong with the patient-parent-professional triangle which meant she did not get the care she needed," she said.
Paramedics described their "shock" at Emily's "grossly extended abdomen" when she collapsed at St Austell in February 2013 and said she was "vomiting faeces".
The inquest was told that Emily, who was home-educated, had a history of constipation that could be linked to her anxiety and mild autism.
Her sister Hannah Herbert raised concerns about the impact "parental anxieties" had on her, and said she had warned social services "something terrible might happen" the year before.
Her brother-in-law Brian Herbert told the inquest Emily's decision not to be examined or go to hospital would have been influenced by the fact her parents "could not cope" with that.
However Emily's GP, Dr Alistair James, said her mother Geraldine Titterington had tried to persuade her to be examined and he found no evidence of safeguarding issues.
Consultant paediatrician Dr Paul Davis said "self-neglect" played a part in her death but she should have been persuaded to go to hospital.
A serious case review by Cornwall Council's Safeguarding Children Board has made several recommendations including that agencies share concerns raised by a family member.
Dr Carlyon said she was satisfied "most of the recommendations have been actioned and embedded".
---Sum/Tgt: A 16-year-old died from chronic constipation because either she, or she and her parents, resisted the care she needed, a coroner has said.

===Input Doc/Src: Japan administers the uninhabited Senkaku islands, which China also claims under the name Diaoyu islands.
Russian naval ships were also spotted in the area at the same time, Japanese local media said.
In 2012, relations between Japan and China deteriorated after Japan bought the islands from a private owner.
The islands are important because they are close to key shipping lanes, offer rich fishing grounds and lie near potential oil and gas reserves.
Reacting to the incident, Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga expressed "serious concern" at a news conference, saying it would escalate tensions.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has told his government to work closely with the US and other countries to deal with this, Mr Suga said.
How uninhabited islands soured China-Japan ties
"Around 00:50 am (15:30 GMT Wednesday), a Chinese naval vessel entered our nation's contiguous waters surrounding the Senkaku Islands," the Japanese foreign ministry said in a statement.
Japan's Vice-Foreign Minister Akitaka Saiki summoned China's ambassador Cheng Yonghua to lodge a protest.
Mr Saiki told the ambassador that the Senkakus are an inherent part of Japan's territory, in terms of history and international law, NHK reported.
He demanded the vessel swiftly move away from the area. Local media reported the vessel left the area around 03:10 local time.
Mr Cheng said the Chinese frigate was allowed to sail in those waters, said Kyodo news agency citing an unnamed source.
Three Russian military vessels were also seen in the waters around the disputed islands, according to Jiji Press, entering around 21:50 on Wednesday and leaving around 03:05 on Thursday.

===Input Doc/Src: Regulator Ofcom ruled the performance, by Alexandr Magala of Moldova, was "in line with audience expectations".
It also rejected suggestions the act might lead to copycat behaviour.
"The repeated warnings and clear references to the inherent danger of the act meant it was very unlikely that audiences would attempt to copy it."
Magala is no stranger to the ...Got Talent format, having previously appeared on the US, French, Italian, Russian and Ukrainian versions of the show.
The 26-year-old also performed at the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics in Sochi in 2014 prior to his ITV debut on 9 April.
Audience members screamed and covered their eyes as the Magala slid down a pole with a sword lodged in his mouth, coming to a stop an inch above the ground.
"I actually thought you were going to die," judge Simon Cowell admitted after the act was put through to the next round of the competition.
The impresario later described Magala's oesophageal exertions as "the most dangerous act... ever seen on Britain's Got Talent".
The same programme drew three complaints over its language, another three relating to animal welfare and another related to "generally accepted standards".
These complaints will also not be investigated, according to the media regulator's latest broadcast and on demand bulletin.
---Sum/Tgt: ITV show Britain's Got Talent will not be investigated by the broadcasting watchdog over a sword-swallowing act that drew 33 complaints.

===Input Doc/Src: The rise of the far-left Podemos party and centrist Citizens means the next general election, at the end of this year, is set to be a four-horse race.
For over three decades the Socialists (PSOE) and centre-right Popular Party (PP) have alternated in power, accounting for over 70% of the vote in past general elections.
But the impact of austerity policies and a focus on corruption has created unprecedented uncertainty.
And the "indignant" protest movement, which camped out in Madrid's central square in the summer of 2011, changed the nation's viewpoint on corruption.
The shift has been highlighted by an opinion poll that puts the one-year-old Podemos in the lead on 22.5%, the Socialists second with 20.2%, the PP third on 18.6% and Citizens, or Cs as the party has branded itself, with 18.4%.
A former PP treasurer revealed wholesale illegal financing of his party while the Socialist regional government in Andalusia oversaw a fraud totalling hundreds of millions of euros diverted from funds meant to help the unemployed.
Both are now stuck with the label of "la casta" (the caste), a term coined to great effect by Podemos.
Podemos is the brainchild of a group of leftist political science university lecturers, headed by gifted orator Pablo Iglesias.
Only four months after they were founded, they attracted 8% share of the vote in last May's European elections.
Podemos argues Spain's crisis was a swindle on the part of the country's financial and political elite and vows to renegotiate its debt to its creditors in the same way as Greece's radical Syriza government is doing.
Under Podemos, evictions of homeowners would be halted and welfare guaranteed for families hit by Spain's 24% unemployment rate.
"We didn't set up Podemos to become like the PSOE or PP - historical parties for our children and grandchildren to join as heirs of the founders," says the party's chief political analyst, Carolina Bescansa, a university lecturer.
"Our idea was to create a tool to allow people

===Input Doc/Src: Lord Healey was Labour's defence secretary from 1964 to 1970 and chancellor of the exchequer from 1974 to 1979 before becoming deputy party leader in opposition in 1980.
The former Leeds MP's family said he died peacefully at his Sussex home on Saturday, after a short illness.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he was "a Labour giant". The PM said he was a "huge figure of post-war politics".
BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said Lord Healey's death marked the end of an era in Labour's history.

'A great man': Tributes paid
Mr Corbyn tweeted: "Denis Healey was a Labour giant whose record of service to party and country stands as his testament. All our thoughts are with his family."
Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he was "absolutely loyal to the Labour Party" and a "towering intellect".
Prime Minister David Cameron wrote on Facebook: "We've lost a huge figure of post-war politics. A hero in World War Two as Beach Master at Anzio and a brave politician, Denis Healey told his party hard truths about Britain having to live within her means."
Lord Healey served as an MP for Leeds for 40 years from 1952 before joining the House of Lords in 1992.
A defining moment in his career came in 1976 when, as chancellor, he applied for an emergency loan from the the International Monetary Fund in an effort to save the pound from collapse.
He came close to winning the Labour leadership in 1980, finishing just 10 votes behind winner Michael Foot.
A graduate of Oxford university, he also served in the Army, joining operations in North Africa, Sicily and Italy during World War Two.
His wife, Edna, died in 2010.

===Input Doc/Src: The targeted area is controlled by the so-called Islamic State group and has been under heavy bombardment from government-aligned forces.
Dozens of people are said to have been killed during the combined assaults.
IS members recaptured the city on Sunday, hours after Russian air strikes appeared to have driven them back.
Sources in Hama province reported seeing dead bodies with no visible injuries, according to the UK-based group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
The death toll was put at at least 40 by one citizens' group in Hama province.
The Syrian government and its Russian backers have previously denied using chemical weapons.
IS was previously driven out of the ancient desert city of Palmyra in March with the support of Russian air strikes, but the jihadist group seized it again in a sudden assault that started last week.
The surprise setback for Syrian government forces came as they and their allies turned their attention to fighting local opposition forces in Aleppo and Damascus.
IS destroyed a number of monuments and beheaded the archaeological director during its 10-month occupation of the Unesco World Heritage site and the adjacent city of Tadmur.
Two 2,000-year-old temples, an arch and funerary towers were left in ruins.
The jihadist group, which has also demolished several pre-Islamic sites in neighbouring Iraq, believes that such structures are idolatrous.

===Input Doc/Src: Pathologist Prof Guy Rutty said David "Les" Ross, 39, had probably been rolled "in a foetal position" when he was attacked on 17 December 2012 at Corby's Village Inn Express.
Sitting at Kettering Magistrates' Court, coroner Anne Pember recorded a verdict of "unlawful killing".
Mr Ross's family said his death was "a senseless act of violence".
Northamptonshire Police are treating his death as murder and an investigation is ongoing. No-one from the force attended the inquest.
Mrs Pember said Mr Ross was well known in Corby, where he had previously worked as a taxi driver and nightclub bouncer, and had opened the Rubix nightclub in the weeks before he died.
Leanne Martin, who worked at the Village Inn Express in The Jamb, told the inquest Mr Ross had asked to stay in the hotel because his own house in Chelveston Drive had been broken into.
Another worker at the hotel, Paige Lindsay, said she had discovered Mr Ross's body "on his back with his feet towards the door".
Paramedic Michael Rowlatt told the inquest Mr Ross had been wearing boxer shorts and a white vest or t-shirt. He said there had been blood on the carpet and on the bed side cabinet.
Prof Rutty said Mr Ross had injuries to his face, chest and arms. He said some of the wounds might have been from a fight the previous night, but that others were caused by a "ring on a fist".
A statement from his family said they are "torn apart with grief" by an attack "carried out in a cowardly manner".

===Input Doc/Src: It is the last day of the Indian prime minister's tour of China and he is meeting some of the heads of Chinese industry. He will be hoping that they will be able to drive forward his signature policy, 'Make in India'.
But one year into his term as prime minister and many say Mr Modi is showing some distinctly undemocratic tendencies as he tries to foster a manufacturing boom in India.
At the end of April, India cancelled the registration of nearly 9,000 foreign-funded non-governmental organisations (NGOs), saying they didn't comply with the country's tax codes.
And the Indian government has singled out the environmental pressure group, Greenpeace, for special attention.
The reason why says a lot, both about Mr Modi's ambitions for India and his attitude to dissent.
This week Greenpeace won a small victory.
On Wednesday the government lifted its ban on activist Priya Pillai travelling abroad.
In January she was stopped from travelling to the UK to testify to British MPs about the effects of coal mining in India.
But the war is far from over.
The charity says it will have to close down in a matter of weeks unless the Indian government lifts the financial freeze it has imposed on the NGO.
A secret report from India's Intelligence Bureau, leaked last year, explains why India's government has such a beef with the environmental charity.
It said campaigns headed by Greenpeace and other NGOs had drained three percentage points off the nation's annual growth rate.
Greenpeace wouldn't claim to have been anywhere near that influential but its campaign against the coal industry does strike at the heart of the 'Make in India' policy.
Coal is the main source of power in India and is central to the BJP government's plans to boost industrial production.
It is also the most polluting of all fossil fuels and a key driver of climate change.
And, when it comes to coal, India compares poorly even with China, as Mr Modi's visit highlights.

===Input Doc/Src: Francis Cadell's depiction of ''George Street and Charlotte Square'' was whitewashed over and the canvas was reused by the son of another colourist, Samuel Peploe.
The Scottish Gallery in Edinburgh discovered the missing Cadell during conservation.
It is estimated that the painting could sell for more than Â£50,000.
The Scottish Colourists were four post-impressionist painters, Peploe and Cadell, along with John Leslie Hunter and John Duncan Fergusson.
They absorbed and reworked the strong and vibrant colours of contemporary French painting into a distinctive Scottish idiom during the 1920s and 1930s.
The lost Cadell work was painted around 1909 from his studio at 112 George Street, Edinburgh, and looks across the street to Charlotte Square.
When the artist died in 1937, his sister Jean Percival Clark, well-known as the actress Jean Cadell, came up to Edinburgh to sort out his affairs.
She was helped by Denis Peploe, son of Samuel, who was a student at Edinburgh College of Art.
She gifted him some of her brother's art material and included among the canvases, probably including "George Street and Charlotte Square", taken off its stretcher, turned and re-stretched ready to be used again.
It is not known why Cadell abandoned the painting, which is finished and bears a strong signature.
Years later, Denis Peploe painted his own picture, Begonias, a still life on a trestle table and whitewashed over the Cadell exposed on the other side.
The Scottish Gallery acquired the Denis Peploe and in the process of conservation discovered the Cadell on the reverse.
Denis's son, Guy, who is director of the Scottish Gallery, told BBC Scotland that he had bought the painting at auction and was shocked when he got a call from the picture conservator.
"He said 'I think there's something interesting on the other side of the picture'.
"I said go-ahead take it off its stretcher and see what we can see. He called back a few minutes later and said 'bottom left hand corner, signature FCB Cad

===Input Doc/Src: The bidding is slow and stuttering. "All that wait for nothing," mutters the auctioneer as a telephone bidder thinks long and hard about a making a higher offer before changing his mind.
Most works sell at the low end of their estimated price range. Constable's The Lock, for instance, fetches $13.5m (Â£9.1m) when it was estimated to sell for as much as $17.8m.
It is an oddly subdued end to the year, because the headlines in the media were suggesting that in 2015 the art market caught fire.
In May, Picasso's Les Femmes d'Alger, Version O, sold at Christie's in New York for $179.3m (Â£120.6m). Bidders in the auction room erupted in applause: it is the highest price ever paid for a work at auction.
Then, in November, a Chinese businessman paid $170.4m for Modigliani's Nu Couche (Reclining Nude) - the second-highest price ever fetched at auction.
However, 2015 also saw seen many auction flops. Claude Monet's Nympheas sold for $33.8m, well below its top estimate of $50m and Andy Warhol's Four Marilyns sold for $36m rather than the expected $40m.
It seems that many of the world's millionaires are now feeling worried about the future, and are opting to keep their wealth in cash.
This is particularly true of rich Chinese, who now make up a fifth of the world's buyers of art.
Turbulence on the Shanghai stock exchange in 2015, an economic slowdown and tough anti-corruption laws have persuaded many to stop splashing out on art.
"At the very, very top of the market - amongst billionaires who are really keen to get a great work by a really famous-name artist like Picasso - there is still a lot of competition", says Jane Morris, editor of The Art Newspaper, based in London.
"Once you go under that, where we're talking prices in the millions of dollars, people are feeling more squeezed.
"There's much less confidence in the Chinese market. The Russians are feeling much poorer. People in general are feeling poorer, and that has had an impact."

===Input Doc/Src: The Australian and Malaysian governments say the search will now focus on an area 1,100km (684 miles) north-east of the previous zone.
The move was based on further analysis of radar data that showed the plane was going faster, thus using more fuel.
The Beijing-bound airliner disappeared on 8 March with 239 people on board.
Malaysian officials have concluded that, based on satellite data, it flew into the sea somewhere in the southern Indian Ocean. So far no trace of it has been found.
Search efforts had until Friday morning focused on an area some 2,500km (1,550 miles) to the south-west of the Australian city of Perth.
Did previous photos show plane debris?
Using satellite images, several nations have identified objects floating in the sea in that search area, but these have not been located and there is no evidence that they are related to the plane.
John Young, general manager of Amsa's emergency response division, said that teams had "moved on" from that area based on the new information.
Acting Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said that the fact that the search area had moved did not discount the earlier satellite images of possible debris further south.
"Because of ocean drift, this new search area could still be consistent with the potential objects identified by various satellite images over the past week," Mr Hussein said.
A statement from Amsa - which is co-ordinating the search - said the new information had come from the international investigation team in Malaysia.
This was based on "continuing analysis of radar data between the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca before radar contact was lost", Amsa said.
"It indicated that the aircraft was travelling faster than previously estimated, resulting in increased fuel usage and reducing the possible distance the aircraft travelled south into the Indian Ocean."

===Input Doc/Src: The new regulations - which permit drilling from outside the protected areas - were approved by 298 to 261.
Opposition parties and campaigners criticised the lack of a Commons debate - and accused ministers of a U-turn as they previously pledged an outright ban on fracking in national parks.
The government said its plans would protect "our most precious landscapes".
Energy Minister Andrea Leadsom also said there had already been "enormous debate" on the subject.
MPs overwhelmingly rejected a bid to suspend drilling for shale gas in a Commons vote in January, during which ministers also pledged an "outright ban" on fracking in national parks.
Labour has said the government's plans, contained in a draft regulation, represent a U-turn on this commitment, and called for stronger safeguards.
The proposals, first set out in July, would only allow fracking 1,200m below national parks, Areas of Outstanding National Beauty, the Norfolk and Suffolk Broads and World Heritage Sites.
The drill rigs would have to be positioned outside the boundaries of the protected areas.
Q&A: What is fracking?
Sites of Special Scientific Interest, which are designated to protect wildlife or geology, are not mentioned.
MPs opposed the passing of the draft regulation when it was read out in the Commons on Tuesday evening. Because this happened after the conclusion of the day's main business, parliamentary rules required the vote to be deferred - until Wednesday.
Under this process of so-called deferred divisions, MP voted on the proposal by filling in ballot papers with the result announced later by Deputy Speaker Natascha Engel.
Shadow energy secretary Lisa Nandy accused ministers of using a "parliamentary backdoor" to try to approve the "weak regulations" without debate.
She said: "Fracking should not go ahead in Britain until stronger safeguards are in place to protect drinking water sources and sensitive parts of our countryside like national parks."

"It was supposed to be 40ft high but the wife wouldn't let me go any higher," said Mr Hayes, who also built his own home.
The tower is made up of six box sections welded and stacked on top of each other and tethered to a wall.
Mr Hayes spends three hours twice a week weeding and watering his upwardly mobile flower be, and has already given it a replanting makeover.
The part-time office furniture salesman said he thought up the project when he was left with a surplus of steel struts after recycling some office desks.
"My wife loves it to bits, so do all my neighbours," he said.
"The reason I'm proud of it is it's a one-off, it looks beautiful and I didn't need any help to make it, everything was done by me, nobody even handed me even a spanner."
With its overhanging cover, the pots in Mr Hayes's flower tower each contain five different plants.
Initially, they had daffodils and tulips but when those died out he replaced them with fuchsias, geraniums, pansies and others.
The couple live in the bungalow Mr Hayes built over three levels himself almost 40 years ago.
He has also worked as a window builder and fitter and has done odd jobs throughout his life.

People gathered to collect spilt fuel when another fire broke out, said one senior police official.
At least 14 other Nato tankers were damaged in  a separate attack nearby, at the Torkham border crossing.
The region is a crucial transport route for supplies destined for Nato forces in Afghanistan but the convoys frequently come under attack from militants and criminals.
Local official Shafeerullah Wazir said the tanker was hit by a small bomb in the early hours of the morning.
"The oil tanker caught fire after a blast caused by a small bomb before dawn," the AFP news agency quoted him as saying.
"Villagers from nearby houses rushed and started collecting oil coming out of the destroyed tanker after the fire had been extinguished.
"Suddenly the fire erupted again and at least 15 people including five young boys who had been collecting oil in their buckets were burnt to death."
There were no injuries at the separate attack at Torkham.
No group has claimed responsibility for the attacks, but there has been an increase in Taliban activity since al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden was killed in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad on 2 May.
In the deadliest incident, more than 80 people were killed by a twin suicide bombing targeting police recruits in the north-west.

As the Labour Welsh government does not have an outright majority in the Senedd, it will need some opposition support to get the measure passed as part of the Public Health (Wales) Bill.
The plan, intended to come into force in 2017 and the first in the UK, has divided opinion among health and medical groups.
Some anti-smoking campaigners have opposed restrictions, saying e-cigarettes help smokers kick the habit.
But Health Minister Mark Drakeford has said it is a "balance of risk", claiming restrictions on e-cigarettes will deter children from smoking.
In a report on Monday, the committee said it agreed with the bill's other proposals, including a licensing scheme for tattoo and piercing parlours, and a ban on intimate piercings for under 16s.
---Sum/Tgt: Plans to ban the use of e-cigarettes in enclosed public places have divided a group of AMs looking at the proposal.

===Input Doc/Src: Fridays Ltd, which produces thousands of free range eggs in Cranbrook, wants to expand its operation in Horsmonden.
Residents fear the extra traffic and noise from the 32-hectare site will have a detrimental impact on the area.
The company said it was responding to a 5% year-on-year increase in demand for free range eggs.
The family-run business is one of the three biggest egg producers and packers in the country.
If agreed, its new chicken farm would be located at Pullens Farm, in Lamberhurst Road, which is on the outskirts of the village of Horsmonden.
Resident Sarah Overton said: "The sheer scale of this development is extraordinary.
"We're talking the equivalent of 80 football pitches, 64,000 birds at any one time producing 360,000 eggs a week, using mechanical processes and only needing one full-time person to look after them, and three part-time egg collectors.
"It equates to industrialisation in the countryside, which is bad enough, but this is industrialisation of an area of outstanding natural beauty with protected species that we all need to be careful to preserve," she said.
Fridays Ltd has lodged its application with Tunbridge Wells Borough Council, with a provisional decision expected in August.
Horsmonden Parish Council is discussing the plans on Monday.
---Sum/Tgt: Plans by a company that wants to put 64,000 chickens on an area of outstanding natural beauty in Kent have been met with anger by local residents.

The auction in Newbury saw strong bidding with some items more than doubling their estimated guide price.
The instruments were bought by collectors in the UK, China, USA and Germany.
Proceeds from the auction, which topped £835,462, will go to the Finchcocks Charity, which works to keep historical instruments in playing condition.
Dr Graham Wells, specialist at Dreweatts and Bloomsbury Auctions, said: "This has stood out as one of the most exciting auctions that I have worked on."
The collection was put up for sale after Finchcocks Museum in Goudhurst, Kent - owned by Mr Burnett - closed in December following his retirement.

Swedish energy company Vattenfall said six turbines had so far been installed on its site, off Herne Bay.
All 15 will be switched on later this year, and it is expected they will be fully operational and exporting power to the national grid by early 2016.
Matthew Green, project director, said the original 30 turbines could produce enough power for 40,000 homes.
The additional 15, which are slightly larger, will be enough for another 35,000 homes.
"They have larger rotors so we're able to make use of lower wind speeds to get more power," Mr Green said.
Vattenfall also owns and operates the Thanet offshore wind farm.

===Input Doc/Src: Olympic Games-qualified O'Flaherty will defend her Seeley Cup title in Ormeau Park after finishing fourth at Sunday's Irish Cross Country Championships.
Men's holder Pollock will not compete in the Belfast race.
Pollock has opted to return to his regular training base in London ahead of the European Cross Country tests.
The Holywood man was third in the men's race an Santry which represented his first competitive outing since running the Berlin Marathon in September.
Pollock went into the Irish European trials as the defending champion but he insisted that he was content with his third place on his return to racing after his Berlin disappointment.
The medical doctor achieved the Olympics marathon standard in Berlin but was only the fourth Irishman over the finish line in the German capital which means he will have to race again in the spring if he wants to achieve his Rio ambition.
In his regular blog, the latest instalment of which was published earlier this week, Pollock revealed that, after the suggestion of his coach Andy Hobdell, he opted to take several weeks off following his Berlin exertions.
The Santry race represented Pollock's return to competitive action and his target was to secure the top-three finish which would guarantee a sixth appearance at the European Cross Country Championships
"On each of the previous five attempts at the Europeans I have run poorly, having peaked for the Irish trials," said Pollock in his blog.
"This year however, I know that, at least, I will be in better shape than what I was at Santry.
"With three weeks of hard training ahead of me and the knowledge that my fitness should come back quickly, the nerves are already setting in.

===Input Doc/Src: Canon Bill Brassell from Gloucester served in the Royal Navy in the 1940s, and battled storms, bombers and U-boats to ferry war supplies to Russia.
He has been awarded the Arctic Star medal for the maritime missions, which Winston Churchill said were the most dangerous of the war.
"I'm very, very grateful to receive this," he told the BBC.
"It's only 70 years I suppose, and at last it's happened. Not just because it's a nice thing for me, but because of all those who served with me and they paid the supreme sacrifice.
"Of all the bits that one served during the war, this was the effort that was made by so many.
"I take it [medal] very much in memory of all those who didn't come back, all my shipmates, and that's something that I will very much treasure".
The medal presentation took place at the headquarters of Gloucester-based A Company 6 Rifles.
In 2005, an Arctic badge was awarded to the veterans of the convoys but they felt that it did not go far enough.
They lobbied the government for a specific medal to recognise the service of those involved in the mission.
The Arctic Star medal was created this year.
"This is a medal that we've introduced to honour those people who served on the Arctic convoys in World War II," said Conservative MP Mark Francois, the minister of state for defence personnel, welfare and veterans.
"I'm privileged to present this to Canon Brassell."
The Arctic convoys brought crucial supplies and weapons to Russia, to help fight off Hitler's armies.
The icy voyages claimed over 3,000 lives and Winston Churchill described them as the worst journey in the world.
The supply ships were under constant threat of attack by German U-boats and aircraft and also had to negotiate severe cold, storms, and ice floes.
The voyages began in 1941 and by May 1945, the Arctic route had claimed 104 merchant ships and 16 military vessels.

===Input Doc/Src: The bus was travelling to the Monastery of St Samuel the Confessor, 135km (85 miles) south of Cairo, from Minya province when it came under fire.
No group immediately said it was behind the attack.
But Islamic State (IS) militants have targeted Copts several times in recent months, and vowed to do so again.
Two suicide bombings at Palm Sunday services at churches in the northern cities of Alexandria and Tanta on 9 April left 46 people dead.
Another suicide bombing at a church in the capital in December killed 29 people, while a Christian community was forced to flee the town of el-Arish in the northern Sinai peninsula after a series of gun attacks in February.
The Copts killed on Friday had been travelling to St Samuel's monastery to pray.
Their bus was in a small convoy that was stopped on a desert road near Adwa police station by between eight and 10 gunmen wearing military uniforms, officials cited witnesses as saying. The gunmen then fired at the bus with automatic weapons before fleeing in three 4x4 vehicles, they added.
A Christian official in Minya, Ibram Samir, told the New York Times that children had been on the bus and were among the dead.
Mr Samir said a pick-up truck carrying workmen at the monastery was also in the convoy. It is not clear whether it was targeted as well.
Minya governor Essam al-Bedawi said security forces had arrived at the scene and were fanning out along the road to the monastery and setting up checkpoints.
Copts make up about 10% of Egypt's population of 92 million.
Last month's attacks prompted President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi to declare a three-month nationwide state of emergency and promise to do whatever was necessary to confront jihadist militants, most of whom are based in northern Sinai.
But many Copts complain that the Egyptian authorities are not doing enough to protect them, says the BBC's Orla Guerin in Cairo.

But the scene of the deadliest ever attack carried out by so-called Islamic State (IS) anywhere in the world is still a makeshift shrine. On 3 July, 292 Iraqis lost their lives here.
This week, the haunting strains of a cello wafted through the cavernous black hulks where two popular centres once drew in Iraqis for shopping and socialising.
"If terrorists are trying to turn every element of life into a battlefield, I will turn it into a field of beauty and civilisation," declares Karim Wasifi, composer and conductor with Iraq's National Symphony Orchestra.
He has played his cello at other major bomb sites in Baghdad as an affirmation of Iraqis' determination to fight back.
Hardly a day goes by without an attack somewhere in a city laced with security checkpoints and armed guards.
But the explosion in Baghdad's Karrada neighbourhood was no ordinary bomb. From its design to its destination, this attack underlines that IS has found a new way to inflict harm and cause terror.
"Daesh used, for the first time, a new tactic which helped it to move undetected through checkpoints," a Western security source in Baghdad tells me, using the name for IS more commonly used in the region.
"We've never seen it before, and it's very worrying."
Precise details of the attack, which is under Iraqi investigation, are still being pieced together.
The tactic known as a VBIED - vehicle-borne improvised explosive device - is now widely used in suicide bombings.
But this one is said to differ in the way the explosives were placed in the van, and how the chemicals were put together.
"It's really difficult to make," an explosives expert who has knowledge of the investigation explained, saying the device may have been developed in the Iraqi city of Falluja when it was under IS control.

===Input Doc/Src: A police officer told the BBC that two people were killed after a gunman believed to be the killer of a policewoman in Montrouge entered the supermarket near Porte de Vincennes.
Armed police have flooded the area.
In Dammartin-en-Goele, 35km (22 miles) north-east of Paris, the Charlie Hebdo suspects are also holding a hostage.
The Islamist militants are inside a small printing business and have reportedly said they are prepared to die.
Twelve people were shot dead and 11 were injured in Wednesday's attack on the office of Charlie Hebdo, a satirical magazine which freely mocks religion.
The unprecedented attack shocked France and there has been an outpouring of sympathy and solidarity worldwide.
Armed anti-terror teams have surrounded the Hypercacher supermarket on avenue de la Porte de Vincennes in eastern Paris, where a gunman is said to be holding five hostages.
He knew at least one of the suspected Charlie Hebdo attackers, brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi, a source told AFP news agency.
The gunman has threatened to kill his captives if police seek to capture the brothers, reports citing police say.
Schools near the supermarket are under lockdown.
Separately police have ordered the closure of all shops in the Marais, a traditionally Jewish area in the heart of Paris's central tourist district.
The gunman in eastern Paris is also suspected to be behind the shooting of a policewoman in the southern suburb of Montrouge on Thursday.
French police have issued an appeal for witnesses to that shooting. They said they were looking for two people: a man called Amedy Coulibaly, 32, and a woman called Hayat Boumeddiene, 26.
The two were thought to be "armed and dangerous", French police said.
The Charlie Hebdo attackers, linked by intelligence officials to militant groups, shouted Islamist slogans during the shooting at the magazine office on Wednesday and then fled Paris in a hijacked car, heading north.

===Input Doc/Src: Physics suggests equal amounts of matter and antimatter should have been made in the Big Bang.
In 2010, researchers at the Tevatron accelerator claimed preliminary results showing a small excess of matter over antimatter as particles decayed.
The team has submitted a paper showing those results are on a firmer footing.
Each of the fundamental particles known has an antimatter cousin, with identical properties but opposite electric charge.
When a particle encounters its antiparticle, they "annihilate" each other, disappearing in a high-energy flash of light.
The question remains: why did this not occur in the early Universe with the equal amounts of matter and antimatter, resulting in a Universe devoid of both?
The Tevatron results come from a shower of particles produced at the facility when smashing protons into their antimatter counterparts, antiprotons.
The proton-antiproton collisions in turn create a number of different particles, and the team operating the Tevatron's DZero detector first noticed a discrepancy in the decay of particles called B mesons.
These decayed into pairs of particles called muons alongside pairs of their antimatter versions, antimuons. But, as the team reported in May 2010 in a paper published in Physical Review Letters, there was a notable 1% excess of the matter particles.
However, unpicking important events in the soup of interactions created in particle physics experiments meant that those measurements were associated with a level of uncertainty - reflecting the probability that the effect they see is a random statistical occurrence, rather than new physics.
The researchers now have 50% more data to work with, and have tried to establish that their earlier result in fact came from the particle decays that they first proposed.
As they reported this Thursday, they have now reduced the uncertainty in their experiment to a level of "3.9 sigma", or 3.9 standard deviations - equivalent to a 0.005% probability that the effect is a fluke.
But

===Input Doc/Src: The four-match contest should have begun in Brisbane on Thursday, but that Test will now start on 17 December.
The traditional Melbourne Boxing Day Test is unchanged, but the Sydney Test is put back three days to 6 January.
The changes have been made because of welfare concerns for Australia's players grieving for Hughes, 25, whose funeral will take place on Wednesday.
The left-handed Australia opener died on Thursday after being struck on the neck by a ball during a domestic Sheffield Shield match.
The funeral service will take place in the sports hall of Macksville High School, which Hughes attended, and will be broadcast live in Australia and on big screens at the Sydney Cricket Ground and Adelaide Oval.
"Nobody should underestimate just what these players are going through right now," said Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland.
"These are difficult days and we need to support them in dealing with their grief. It's very clear that playing a Test right now is just too soon and we are reacting accordingly.
"While this wasn't done by design, it is somewhat fitting that the first Test will take place in Adelaide at Phillip's adopted home ground where we hope the match can be a seen as a celebration of his life."
The India squad, currently in Adelaide, were supposed to fly to Brisbane on Monday but missed their flight.
Their two-day warm-up match against a Cricket Australia XI in Adelaide, scheduled for Friday and Saturday last week, was cancelled.
It has been reported that the Indians may now play a tour game in Adelaide on Thursday and Friday.
After the Test series with India, Australia then face the tourists in a triangular one-day international series that also involves England.
Two of those games have already been switched.

===Input Doc/Src: Claire Darbyshire, 36, killed 67-year-old Brian at their home in Wykeham Green, Dagenham, east London, on 2 September last year.
Afterwards, she claimed they had made a suicide pact as his illness had become "intolerable".
But following an Old Bailey trial, a jury found Darbyshire guilty of murder.
Sentencing her, Recorder of London Nicholas Hilliard QC said he accepted that she believed it was an act of mercy.
He said the key to the case was that she failed to establish her father had agreed she would also kill herself in a suicide pact.
He said: "I accept your evidence that your father did raise the question of ending his own life and he wanted to do that and wanted your help to do so."
But he told her she had unlawfully killed her father behind "closed doors" and no defence to murder applied.
Darbyshire, who was born male but has lived her life as a female, has already spent five months on remand in a men's prison awaiting trial.
Widower Mr Darbyshire developed MS in 1995 and in 2014 the defendant took over as his sole carer.
Prosecutor Jonathan Rees QC told jurors that Mr Darbyshire, a retired Ford stock controller, had not expressed any suicidal thoughts or complained about being in pain to nurses who visited him.
Medical records revealed he had episodes of "bad temper and aggression", but had never tried to kill himself.
Darbyshire complained to a friend about having to look after him and appeared to be stressed.
After the killing she caught a train to the Dover area, having texted the district nurse to visit "asap".
On 3 September, Darbyshire approached a National Trust worker on cliffs for help and ended up with support services in Canterbury.
Five days later she mentioned the suicide pact for the first time. She said they had both taken an overdose on 1 September, which failed to work, before she suffocated her father.

===Input Doc/Src: Her department suggested schools could withdraw places offered to children if their families were found to be living in the country illegally.
The Home Office also wanted schools to carry out immigration checks.
Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said the plan was "disgusting".
'Not government policy'
Chief Inspector of schools Sir Michael Wilshaw said he was "amazed and shocked" by the claim - while Liberal Democrat education spokesman John Pugh dismissed it as "a grubby little idea".
But immigration minister Robert Goodwill insisted that deprioritising school places for children of people in the UK illegally is "not the policy of the government".
The government said it would not comment on leaked documents, but added that it was right that a range of options would be considered before ministers made a final decision.
By law, children under 16 have a right to an education whatever their parents' circumstances.
But the documents suggested the Home Office wanted schools to ask to see passports before accepting new pupils.
In summer 2015, Theresa May wanted Whitehall departments to contribute to the government's ambition to reduce immigration to the tens of thousands.
One source says every department was to have its hands "dipped in blood". But the letters reveal there was a "disquiet among our own ministers about the potential for inflammatory comparisons" by using schools as part of the immigration system, punishing the children of illegal immigrants by putting them to the bottom of the list for school places.
After discussions at a cabinet committee, Nicky Morgan, then education secretary, wrote twice to the then Prime Minister David Cameron with "profound concerns" about the Home Office's plan for schools.
It is not clear how wide-ranging the plans were, but the Department of Education is only responsible for schools in England.

===Input Doc/Src: It has announced that loans made to students in England between 2002 and 2006 will be put up for sale - to be followed by other pre-2012 loans - with the aim of raising £12bn.
Universities Minister Jo Johnson said the sale would have "no impact on people with student loans".
But the National Union of Students said it was an "ugly move on students".
"It is outrageous that bankers will profit off the backs of graduates who took out loans because they had no other option," said the union's vice-president Sorana Vieru.
The government has had a long-standing aim to sell the student loan book to private investors - with types of loans being sold in separate stages.
Over the next four years it aims to dispose of the loans from before 2012, when tuition fees in England were trebled to £9,000 per year.
The slice of loans now being put on sale - dating from 2002 to 2006 - have a face value of £4bn.
The government is promising that there will be "no changes to the terms and conditions" for borrowers - so that rates of repayment for former students will remain the same.
It means that interest on these student loans will become an income for private investors, but repayments will continue to be collected through taxation and the Student Loans Company.
The Intergenerational Foundation think tank has calculated that a student borrowing for three years' tuition could pay back £54,000 - before debts are cancelled after 30 years.
The Universities Minister Jo Johnson says the sale of assets is part of the drive to bring "public finances under control".
But he said it would "only proceed once we are satisfied that it represents value for money for the taxpayer".
David Gauke, chief secretary to the Treasury, said it was the right time to start the sale process.
"This sale makes sense for taxpayers and will play an important contribution in our work to repair the public finances," he said.

===Input Doc/Src: The Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish administrations have their spending level dictated by the Barnett formula.
Under it, extra funding or cuts for England has an affect on the other nations, dependent on their population size and the powers devolved to them.
Stormont's finance committee says parts of the formula could be more open.
That could include requiring the Treasury to publish data upon which Barnett-related decisions are based.
As an example, the committee pointed to the initial Treasury decision to classify infrastructure spending on the London Olympics as having UK-wide rather than England-only benefits.
That meant there were was no so-called consequential spending for the devolved governments.
The devolved nations did eventually get extra spending, but only about Â£30m rather than the Â£330m they thought they were due.
Some expert witnesses suggested that an independent body, such as the Office for Budget Responsibility, should be given an oversight role.
Prof Gerry Holtham, who produced a report on funding and financing in Wales, told the committee that Northern Ireland would benefit from the formula "being put on a proper statutory basis with an element of independence from Treasury introduced".
The committee also said that the executive should take "pre-emptive measures" for the event that the government decides to dispense with or alter the Barnett formula.
It said this could include piloting a new needs-based formula and developing a "fully considered position" on what arrangements will be in Northern Ireland's best interests.
---Sum/Tgt: The finance ministers of the devolved UK administrations should present joint proposals for improving the way they are funded, a Stormont committee says.

===Input Doc/Src: Monty the Penguin has become an internet sensation after becoming the face (and beak) of this year's John Lewis Christmas advert.
For many, the advert's release marks the countdown to Christmas.
For others, it signals the start of a commercial battle to release the most sentimental and memorable campaign in the hope it will translate into profit.
Adverts from stores like Waitrose, Asda and Aldi are all set to follow, in the meantime let's find out all you need to know about the penguin who's been trending globally across Twitter.
1. Monty is an Adélie penguin which can be found along the Antarctic coast. They are tough, old birds who breed further south than any other penguin. Brrr!
2. Newly-engaged Benedict Cumberbatch is reportedly gutted* at Monty's fame because he struggles to say the word "penguin".
3. The crux of Monty's story is that he is longing for a mate. A chick to call his own. Don't worry Monty, those urges you are feeling are totally natural. When male and female penguins hook up they become inseparable. They even take it in turns to look after their chicks while their partner is out at sea.
4. As the autumn leaves start to fall and seasons start to change, Monty begins searching for his future wife. This is not surprising as Adélie penguins head to breeding grounds at that time of year.
5. Don't let Monty's cute complexion fool you, he can have a sneaky, mean side. During breeding period, Adélie penguins switch from a calm nature to aggressive. Some have even been filmed stealing rocks from their neighbours' nests.
6. Once Christmas is out of the way and Monty's fame has died down, he may decide to ditch his owner, Sam, for a few days and head to a festival, like Glastonbury or Leeds. A BBC crew which has observed his fellow Adélie penguins reckon he would fit right in because they like to build their nests just out of "pecking distance" of their neighbours, like tents at a festival.
7. Watch out! Monty's owner Sam might just be a genius. He regularl

===Input Doc/Src: Pre-tax profits dropped to £49m from £53.5m in 2014.
But the Cardiff-based society - the largest in Wales - said it had helped 3,500 first-time buyers onto the housing ladder, up by 1,200 on the previous year.
It also warned 67 workers at its Nemo secured loans business that they were at risk of redundancy.
It has been trying to offload Nemo and said it would no longer take on any new customers.
However, the building society said it believed it could find jobs for many of the staff within its 1,000 strong workforce.
Meanwhile, Principality, which is the sixth biggest society UK-wide, said mortgage lending to home-buyers had passed the £5bn mark for the first time.
Graeme Yorston, group chief executive, said it had been "another strong 12 months".
He said the society would continue to respond to technological demands, which have included rolling out mortgage interviews on Skype and online appointment booking.
Underlying profit was £57.8m, up from £51.9m.
This included dealing with one-off issues like stopping new lending from its subsidiary Nemo, which provides secure loans on properties.
There has been speculation over recent years that Principality would look to sell this part of its business.
It will continue to manage accounts it currently has.
Mr Yorston said although Nemo had made a £14m profit, it did not want to "increase our participation in this market".
Looking ahead at economic prospects, he said he did not expect to see any rise in the official Bank of England base rate until 2017 and "when it does it is likely to be modest".
---Sum/Tgt: Principality Building Society has announced a dip in its profits for 2015, after a record the year before.

===Input Doc/Src: She met the country's Princess Stephanie and Prime Minister Xavier Bettel at the capital city's museum of modern art, Mudamon.
The Duchess was given a guided tour of the exhibitions by British artists Sir Tony Cragg and Darren Almond.
The treaty, signed in 1867, confirmed Luxembourg's independence and neutrality.
On the trip Kate, who is a patron of the National Portrait Gallery, met people who worked in the arts and charitable sectors in Luxembourg.
She also spoke to Oscar-winning director Laurent Witz, who won an academy award in 2014 for the Best Animated Short Film, Mr Hublot.
Before leaving Luxembourg she was introduced to schoolchildren, aged five and six, from St George's International School.
The UK's deputy ambassador to Luxembourg said: "We have a good strong bilateral relationship and always have with the Luxembourgers, they still very much recognise the role we had in liberating them during the war and we have a very strong relationship between the two financial centres particularly, and that's something we are very anxious to continue and maintain.
"There are also close ties between the two royal families, with three generations of the Luxembourg royal family having been educated at our military academy at Sandhurst."

===Input Doc/Src: Scottish Chambers of Commerce (SCC) chief executive Liz Cameron highlighted the need for 11,000 new roles each year in Scotland's digital and IT sector.
She warned that the vacancies could not be filled entirely by British workers.
Ms Cameron also called for a migration system that responded to Scotland's lower population growth rate.
She said Scotland's projected population growth to 2024 was only 3.1%, compared with a projected 7.5% increase for England over the same period.
She warned that could leave the economy growing more slowly and unable to sustain public service levels.
Ms Cameron's comments came as the prime minister prepares to get Brexit negotiations under way.
Theresa May has set a deadline of 31 March for invoking Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, getting official talks with the EU started.
In a statement, Ms Cameron said: "It is time to make the case for a new migration system that works for the UK, works for Scotland and, above all, works for business.
"Free movement of people across Europe may have led us to become complacent about the effort that is required to target the talents that our businesses need across all sectors and all parts of the UK.
"We need to plan now for a system that will be focused on sourcing the right talent, wherever in the world that exists, and in the numbers that meet the demands of our economy."
Giving greater control over immigration to Holyrood has been a key demand of Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in the wake of the Brexit vote.
However in January the home secretary appeared to rule out the possibility of Scotland being handed powers over immigration after the UK leaves the EU.
Amber Rudd said introducing different rules "would complicate the immigration system, harming its integrity" and cause problems for businesses.
---Sum/Tgt: A Scottish business leader has stepped up calls for a migration system that can fill skills gaps after Britain pulls out of the EU.

===Input Doc/Src: Angus MacNeil, chairman of the House of Commons energy committee, has called for the project to be re-examined.
It follows a letter that EDF chief executive Jean-Bernard Levy sent to his staff, saying the project needed more funding from the French government.
The UK government said it was "committed" to Hinkley Point.
But Mr MacNeil, an MP for the SNP, said the government needed to urgently rethink its support for the proposal.
"It's something that has to be looked into very carefully and very soon because it is a huge obligation and a lot of eggs in quite small baskets," he said.
"The Chinese are involved, the French involved, the UK are involved. They need to take a step back because other places have decided not to go ahead with this stuff."
In his letter to EDF staff, Mr Levy said: "We are currently negotiating with the French state to obtain commitments allowing us to secure our financial position.
"I am sure that this project is a good project for the group and that in the near future, all the conditions will come together for it to be definitely launched.
"It is clear that I will not engage EDF in this project before these conditions are met."
The company, which is 85% owned by the French government and owns 58 reactors in France, is expected to finalise in April how it will fund the project.
It has postponed the decision a number of times. The plan was delayed in January, reportedly owing to funding difficulties.
But Mr Levy highlighted in his letter that China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN), which will own 33.5% of the project, was investing about 8bn euros (£6bn).
He also expressed his confidence in EDF to manage "very large projects".
Pressure is mounting as the £18bn cost of the Hinkley project is more than the entire value of the firm.
And there is scepticism as the British government has agreed to pay more than twice the current wholesale price of energy once the plant is producing - £92.50 per megawatt hour for electricity, against £37 per m
---Sum/Tgt: Fresh doubts have arisen over plans by French Energy firm EDF to build an £18bn nuclear power plant at Hinkley Point, Somerset.

===Input Doc/Src: Online security specialists Cloudflare said it recorded the "biggest" attack of its kind on Monday.
Hackers used weaknesses in the Network Time Protocol (NTP), a system used to synchronise computer clocks, to flood servers with huge amounts of data.
The technique could potentially be used to force popular services offline.
Several experts had predicted that the NTP would be used for malicious purposes.
The target of this latest onslaught is unknown, but it was directed at servers in Europe, Cloudflare said.
Attackers used a well-known method to bring down a system known as Denial of Service (DoS) - in which huge amounts of data are forced on a target, causing it to fall over.
Cloudflare chief executive Matthew Prince said his firm had measured the "very big" attack at about 400 gigabits per second (Gbps), 100Gbps larger than an attack on anti-spam service Spamhaus last year.
In a report published three months ago, Cloudflare warned that attacks on the NTP were on the horizon and gave details of how web hosts could best try to protect their customers.
NTP servers, of which there are thousands around the world, are designed to keep computers synchronised to the same time.
The fundamentals of the NTP began operating in 1985. While there have been changes to the system since then, it still operates in much the same way.
A computer needing to synchronise time with the NTP will send a small amount of data to make the request. The NTP will then reply by sending data back.
The vulnerability lies with two weaknesses. Firstly, the amount of data the NTP sends back is bigger than the amount it receives, meaning an attack is instantly amplified.
Secondly, the original computer's location can be "spoofed", tricking the NTP into sending the information back to somewhere else.
In this attack, it is likely that many machines were used to make requests to the NTP. Hackers spoofed their location so that the massive amounts of data from the NTP were diverted to a single target.
"Ampli
---Sum/Tgt: A massive attack that exploited a key vulnerability in the infrastructure of the internet is the "start of ugly things to come", it has been warned.

===Input Doc/Src: Members of the RMT and TSSA unions backed industrial action following a similar vote by drivers.
Workers in these unions will now join a planned 24-hour walkout by members of the drivers' union Aslef, which begins at 21:30 BST on 8 July.
Talks aimed at averting a strike are being held at the conciliation service Acas.
The RMT union and TSSA said its workers planned to begin striking at 18:30 BST.
The unions are in dispute with London Underground over pay and conditions for the new all-night Tube, which is due to start at weekends from mid-September, on sections of the Central, Jubilee, Northern, Piccadilly and Victoria lines.
The RMT said its members voted by 91% in favour of strikes and 96% for other forms of industrial action.
The union is also in dispute over a series of other issues including jobs and safety.
RMT General Secretary Mick Cash said: "The industrial relations situation on the Tube has sunk to an almost unprecedented low with all four unions united and balloting for action over pay and working arrangements due to be ushered in under the guise of the mayor's 'night Tube' vanity project in just 10 weeks' time."
TSSA General Secretary Manuel Cortes said: "We hope that this result will show Boris Johnson just how angry our members are at his plans to try and rush the start of the night Tube without any detailed agreement on manning levels."
Among TSSA members, the vote in support of strikes was 76%, with 88% backing other forms of action in a turnout of 44%.
London Underground's chief operating officer Steve Griffiths said: "Londoners and businesses overwhelmingly back the Night Tube.
"It will make life easier for everyone, cut journey times, create jobs and boost the economy.
"No-one is being asked to work more hours," he added. "In return, we are offering a realistic pay increase this year and next, as well as an additional payment for Night Tube working. "
---Sum/Tgt: More London Underground workers have voted to strike in a dispute over the new all-night Tube service.

===Input Doc/Src: The terror attacks that traumatised this small nation have dominated political life and the media in Norway ever since.
Norwegians are weary of the wall-to-wall media coverage of the Breivik attacks but they are still searching for answers about what happened that day. In particular, the victims' families want to know why it took police so long to respond.
The former justice minister Knut Storberget and the former chief of security services (PST) Janne Kristiansen, both in charge at the time, were forced to resign under heavy criticism of the handling of the terror attacks.
After months of criticism, the police, the PST and Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg finally apologised in March.
The catalogue of police errors on the day is currently under investigation and will be a main subject of the independent public inquiry into the attacks which is due to be published in August.
Oslo District Court has built a new, custom-made courtroom (no 250) for Breivik's trial, and refurbished two floors to accommodate the media and the many aggrieved parties who will be following the trial. Geir Engebretsen, president of the court, says the trial is estimated to cost around Â£10m (12.1m euros; $15.9m).
He expects there to be between 1,000-1,400 people in the court building every day during the trial, however there are only 190 places available in the main courtroom which are reserved for the victims and members of the press.
An estimated 2,500 people will be able to follow the trial via video link in 18 local courts around the country.
The police have the responsibility of securing the building and have promised that everyone will feel safe. Breivik himself will be protected in court by a bulletproof screen. He has received at least two confirmed death threats in prison.
The case will be heard by a panel of five judges rather than a jury: two professional judges and three lay judges who are general members of the public.
The accused: Anders Behring Breivik (33)
Judges: Wenche Elizab
---Sum/Tgt: Preparations for the trial of Anders Behring Breivik have been going on since his dramatic arrest on the island of Utoeya on 22 July last year.

===Input Doc/Src: After defeats in their past two League One games, Phil Brown's side took an early lead from the penalty spot when Simon Cox fired home.
Southend remain one spot and one point outside the play-off places after sixth-placed Millwall overcame Northampton, while defeat leaves Chesterfield nine points from safety with thee games remaining.
Anthony Wordsworth and Cox breached the static Spireites defence in the second half to kill the contest, while Marc-Antoine Fortune made it four with his first touch after coming off the bench.
Just before the break Dion Donohue was dismissed for a foul on Jason Demetriou to add to Chesterfield's woes.
Cox was the man that earned and scored Southend's 15th-minute penalty. On the ball, he stood firm as goalkeeper Thorsten Stuckmann scampered towards him and when contact was made the referee had an easy decision to make and the spot-kick was duly converted.
Poor defending contributed to United's three second-half goals, Wordsworth converting a Demetriou cross while Cox took advantage of some solid Will Atkinson work before Fortune slipped through a shell-shocked defence to complete the scoring.

"You have pepper spray, you have tear gasâ€¦but we're still freeâ€¦this country is ours," the fans sing.
On the stage at Izmir's seafront is Duman, one of Turkey's best-loved rock bands. As they belt out tunes about the anti-government protests of 2013, the thousands-strong crowd goes wild.
"When I was studying in Poland, people there thought Turkey is a heavily Muslim country; that the women are all covered and men have four wives," laughs Serbay Kos, a volleyball trainer.
"But Izmir isn't like that - we're like Europe and America."
He takes a swig of beer as the song changes.
"I'm worried that this government is trying to make Turkey into a more Muslim country, like Iraq or Syria - but we want to be free."
It is a sentiment you hear frequently in this relaxed, coastal city - Turkey's third largest.
Izmir has always looked across the Aegean to Europe; its Greek heritage and affluent bon-viveur feel shaping its politics.
The centre-left Republican People's Party, or CHP, has its stronghold here - Izmir is known as the "CHP's castle".
Staunchly secular, it is the party of modern Turkey's founding father, Kemal Ataturk.
In the last election, the CHP took 44% of the vote in Izmir - more than double its national share. And it is aiming higher for the poll on 7 June.
Many here fear the growing conservatism of the current government.
Under the 12-year rule of the Islamist-rooted AK Party, constitutionally-secular Turkey has fundamentally changed.
There is now a push to raise a "pious generation" - in the words of Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan - and CHP-dominated Izmir appears increasingly isolated.

Media playback is not supported on this device
There was one worry for Arsenal fans as midfielder Jack Wilshere came off before half-time but Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger said afterwards it was illness rather than injury that prompted the 21-year-old's withdrawal.
That will potentially be a relief to England boss Roy Hodgson, who has two upcoming World Cup qualifiers, starting on Friday.
This absorbing encounter lacked the high-scoring of the 5-2 victories the Gunners have enjoyed over Spurs for the last two seasons. But a fourth consecutive win since they lost to Aston Villa on the opening day was a perfect response from the Gunners to taunts about Arsene Wenger's lack of spending compared with Spurs manager Andre Villas-Boas.
Tottenham have only won once at Arsenal since 1993 and, despite creating several good openings, it was Arsenal who enjoyed the more clear-cut opportunities, Santi Cazorla twice showing his invention from clever free-kicks early on.
Villas-Boas has spent close to £105m on new players this summer but while his side look powerful, they were often lacking the speed of an Arsenal team with more Premier League experience - and it was an illustration of what they might miss without Gareth Bale, who has completed his move to Real Madrid.
There have been 125 goals scored in Premier League meetings between Tottenham and Arsenal, more than any other fixture.
The first-half goal that won the game was a case in point as the ball was swept out to Walcott on the right, the Tottenham defence misjudging their attempt to move up and catch the Gunners attack offside, and the England winger crossed low for the darting Giroud to poke in at

"I've put it into five minutes, and I want you to take that information and go and research yourself."
Swiss, who is best known for being part of So Solid Crew, added: "Gather the information and then make a decision on what you want to do with it."
Before the show, Radio 1Xtra explained to Newsbeat that: "The track, which tackles the complex issues around the word, will be played in the late-night specialist show with full warnings ahead of its play and an appropriate introduction giving context to the song.
"The decision to play the track is based on musical merit and it is in line with audience expectations."
Before playing the five-minute track in full during his 22:00 - 01:00 show, Semtex reflected the mixed response the track has had online.
He said: "In case you haven't heard it this is a track that stopped the internet this week.

"It stopped everybody to put down what they were doing and think about what this guy was saying on the track.
"Some people got offended, some people were like 'I'm glad somebody said that', other people were educated."
The track opens with a series of samples referencing black slavery, including quotes from Django Unchained and references several cases of when the media has reported the term being used in a negative way.
A sequence of lyrics, which ends with the song's title, reiterate the point Swiss made during the interview.
"It can be a term of endearment or an emotional trigger.

===Input Doc/Src: It warns about what it calls "medium-term" dangers in both emerging and developed economies, in its twice-yearly report.
It expresses particular concerns about Europe, Japan and China.
On a more positive note, the fund does say that short-term risks have abated since its previous assessment of global financial stability in April.
Pressures on emerging markets have eased, the report says. Rising commodity prices (though they are still relatively low) have helped and so has the reduced uncertainty about China's prospects in the near term.
The report says investors were taken by surprise by the result of the British referendum on the European Union, but the political shock was absorbed by markets. They passed what it calls "this severe stress test".
But looking further ahead, the IMF sees growing risks.  A key factor is bank profits.
The good news is that banks are in some respects stronger than they were before the financial crisis. They have more capital, a kind of financial buffer that enables them to survive losses. Their liquidity has improved, which means they have more chance of coping if they suddenly have to find funds quickly.
But they are struggling to make money.
Weak profitability makes it harder for them to build up their capital (which they can do by holding on to some profit rather than giving it all to shareholders as dividends). It also makes it harder for them to expand lending to business and consumers, as is needed to support economic recovery.
The problems partly reflect the very low interest rate environment that developed-country banks have to operate in. The struggle to make profits also reflects the persistent economic weakness in the developed world, which means weaker demand for credit.
Some banks in the eurozone have a burden of problem loans, which are not being repaid and that they have still not dealt with.

===Input Doc/Src: One of Afghanistan's largest cities, it has long been a strategically important transport hub for the north of the country.
Kunduz is linked by highways to Kabul in the south, with Mazar-e-Sharif in the west and with Tajikistan in the north.
But it has always held symbolic significance for the Taliban because it was a key northern stronghold before 2001.
Kunduz is considered a gateway to Afghanistan's northern provinces and shares a border with Tajikistan, Afghanistan's Central Asian neighbour.
The border with Tajikistan is porous, and it is used for the smuggling of Afghan opium and heroin to Central Asia, which finally finds its way to Europe.
Any side controlling Kunduz would not only influence the surrounding areas, but could also control one of the most important drug smuggling routes in the region.
Security for the region - which was a flagship project for the German army - was transferred to Afghan forces in 2013.
But Kunduz has many other problems: bad governance as well as incompetence and intimidation by some local officials have alienated many in the province.
It has long been at the frontline of a determined campaign by the Taliban to reclaim it. In May last year the BBC's David Loyn reported from there as fighting between government forces and the Taliban unfolded.
The Taliban already control huge chunks of the province's rural areas, where the majority of the population lives. The insurgents have intensified their fighting in the province over the past two years.
A BBC reporter visited the city after it was back in government hands following its September 2015 capture. He found shock, a jail emptied of prisoners and many residents fearful of a Taliban return.
The battle for the city saw one of the worst incidents in the recent Afghan war when a Medecins sans Frontieres hospital was hit by a US air strike.
The city is  estimated to have about 300,000 residents but those numbers are likely to be fluid because fighting has prompted many to flee the city.

---Sum/Tgt: The brief militant seizure of Kunduz in 2015 was one of the Afghan government's worst setbacks since Taliban forces were ousted in 2001.

===Input Doc/Src: Eight former officers are suing South Wales Police after being cleared of charges relating to the investigation of Lynette White's murder in 1988.
The corruption trial collapsed in 2011.
A hearing in Cardiff was told there was "no intention" to uncover the truth behind the wrongful conviction of the Cardiff Three.
Former officers Graham Mouncher, Thomas Page, Richard Powell, John Seaford, Michael Daniels, Peter Greenwood, Paul Jennings and Paul Stephen are suing the force for misfeasance in public office, false imprisonment and trespass.
Leslie Thomas QC said allegations of pressurising a witness into giving a false statement against Mr Page were "easily rubbished".
He said one witness voluntarily accompanied Mr Page to the police station and had made no allegation of ill treatment "or anything improper".
Cardiff's Civil Justice Centre was told officers investigating allegations of corruption misidentified Mr Page as someone intimidating a witness in an interview, but he "simply wasn't there".
On Monday, the court heard that murderer Jeffrey Gafoor may not have acted alone when he killed Ms White in a flat in Cardiff's docklands on Valentine's Day.
Tony Parris, Stephen Miller and Yusef Abdullahi - who became known as the Cardiff Three - were wrongly jailed for life in 1990 for the murder and freed in 1992 after their convictions were quashed.
The hearing continues.

===Input Doc/Src: It follows hours of disturbances during the early hours of 17 March as hundreds of students and other young people celebrated St Patrick's Day.
The Holyland is a residential part of south Belfast popular with students.
Employment and Learning Minister Stephen Farry is to meet residents' representatives on Monday afternoon.
Eleven people were arrested in the area and the city centre over the St Patrick's Day period. One policeman was injured when bottles were thrown at officers in Agincourt Avenue.
A number of vehicles were also damaged and residents complained about excessive noise and litter in their streets.
There has been a history of trouble in the Holyland on previous St Patrick's Days and talks have been held before in a bid to prevent students engaging in anti-social behaviour.
The chairman of the Holyland Regeneration Association, Ray Farley, said the existing measures had not worked and called for Stormont ministers to intervene.
Speaking last Friday ahead of the meeting, Mr Farry said he was "appalled" by the behaviour of some young people in the area but said the majority of them were not university or college students.
However, he added that further steps to address students' bad behaviour would now be considered in light of this year's trouble.
---Sum/Tgt: Residents of Belfast's Holyland are due to meet the minister responsible for universities later to discuss students' involvement in disorder in their area.

===Input Doc/Src: Shaker Aamer was held at the US military base in Cuba over allegations he had led a Taliban unit and had met Osama Bin Laden, but was never charged.
Downing Street said there were "no plans" to detain him after his arrival.
Mr Aamer said he felt "obliged" to everyone who fought for him to be released, and to "bring an end to Guantanamo".
"My thanks go to Allah first, second to my wife, my family, to my kids and then to my lawyers who did everything they could to carry the word to the world," he said.
"I am overwhelmed by what people have done by their actions, their thoughts and their prayers, and without their devotion to justice I would not be here in Britain now."
Concern has been raised over the health of the Saudi national, 48, whose family live in London, and the BBC witnessed an ambulance arrive at the airport.
Number 10 said Prime Minister David Cameron "welcomes" the release of Mr Aamer, who has permission to live in the UK indefinitely because his wife is British.
It also said any necessary security measures "will be put in place".
The father-of-four landed at London's Biggin Hill Airport shortly before 13:00 GMT.
Mr Aamer's father-in-law, Saeed Siddique, said his release was a "miracle".
"It's a delightful day," he told BBC News while admitting it was also a "surprise".
Mr Aamer, who was first held by US authorities in Afghanistan in 2001, maintains he was in the country doing charity work.
Since 2007 Mr Aamer, who claims he was tortured, has been cleared for release twice, by US presidents George W Bush and then Barack Obama.
It is understood Mr Aamer will go through standard immigration checks now he has arrived in the UK.
Mr Aamer's legal representative Clive Stafford Smith told BBC News: "Shaker only wants the truth to come out he is not interested in persecuting anyone.
"His first priority is health - he really is in terrible shape."
In letters sent to the BBC by his lawyers earlier this month, Mr Aamer described himself as "an old car that has not b

===Input Doc/Src: One migrant, who said he had spent £15,000 so far on trying to reach the UK from Syria, also said many of the criminals were British nationals.
The BBC saw cars with UK number plates at a camp on Dunkirk's outskirts.
The mayor of nearby Teteghem, Franck Dhersin, said UK-registered cars - driven by what he called English mafia - were often spotted there.
He said people in the UK who complained about migrants trying to reach the country did not realise "the cars are English and the owners are English".
The tactics of migrants around Dunkirk are different from those in Calais, where hundreds try to board lorries and scale fences every night to gain entry to the Channel Tunnel.
The Dunkirk migrants are driven to locations where they can try to stow away on lorries.
The Syrian migrant who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity said the £15,000 he had paid traffickers was all of his money.
He has spent £12,000 on getting from Syria to France and a further £3,000 on trying to cross the Channel.
He said migrants were threatened by traffickers if they did not follow orders.
"I'm so, so scared," he said.
"They have guns. They put it to someone's head and said 'You move again and I will kill you'."
It's a similar story at the Teteghem camp a few miles away.
Mr Dhersin said the traffickers were "very violent" and "just want to make money with immigrants".
He said British traffickers had been operating in the area for several years, but were now much more organised.
Until Tuesday he had insisted on visiting the Teteghem camp despite the dangers.
"I wanted to show that a French mayor can go where he wants," he said.
"I said 'I will enter and if you don't want [me to], I will come back with a policeman'."
But Mr Dhersin said that a man there had shown him a gun and threatened to rape a reporter he was with.
Police have advised him not to return.

===Input Doc/Src: The Health Protection Agency (HPA) report said a hot tub on show at JTF Warehouse in Stoke-on-Trent was the probable source of an outbreak in 2012.
Richard Griffin, 64, and 79-year old William Hammersley, both died and 19 other people caught the disease.
The HPA said hot tubs posed a health risk if not regularly maintained.
BBC News has not been able to contact JTF Warehouse for a comment following the HPA report.
The report said: "This was a significant outbreak and has raised questions on the acceptability of operating spa pools (also known as whirl pools and hot tubs) in public places where the general population has access.
"Spa Pools are known to pose a risk of Legionella if water systems are not rigorously maintained, properly managed and subject to regular chemical controls.
"Operating spa pools on display in indoor spaces, even if not used for bathing, have been previously shown to be the cause of outbreaks in other countries," the report added.
Lawyers Irwin Mitchell are taking legal action on behalf of the families of two men who died, as well as 16 other people who caught the disease.
They are calling for a public inquiry into the outbreak.
Clive Garner from the firm said: "We hope that now this report has been published those responsible for the store will admit liability for the illness suffered by our clients so that we can help them to access the exact level of care and support they now need.
"We are currently working with medical experts to investigate their longer term condition and prognosis and we hope to conclude their cases as soon as possible so that they can begin to move on with their lives."

===Input Doc/Src: He was speaking in the first leaders' debate of the Irish general election.
He was responding to Fianna Fáil's Micheál Martin who said he would not form a coalition with Sinn Féin as he does not trust them on security.
He said: "Politicians here could learn a lesson from the unionists, who have more reason to distrust Sinn Féin."
Mr Adams referred to past and present leaders of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), who have led a power-sharing government with Sinn Féin in Northern Ireland since 2007.
"Ian Paisley can go into government with Martin McGuinness, and Peter Robinson can go into government, and Arlene Foster can go into government with Martin McGuinness," Mr Adams said.
The Sinn Féin leader was challenged by one of the debate moderators, Pat Kenny, that the D'Hondt system forces the parties in Northern Ireland together.
The D'Hondt system is a type of proportional representation used to allocate seats and ministerial posts.
Mr Adams said it was the citizens of Northern Ireland make the decisions about who goes into government by them giving a mandate.
Taoiseach Enda Kenny was asked whether the bookmakers' predicted outcome, a Fine Gael/Fianna Fáil coalition, was the most likely outcome.
He replied that voters have a choice between "the party that wrecked the country, or two parties with different perspectives who have worked together to set the country on the path to recovery". He said Fine Gael/Labour will provide stability.
When the debate moved to the Irish economy, Labour leader Joan Burton accused Sinn Féin of "fuzzy economics" which would kill jobs.
The Irish deputy prime minister said she is mystified by Sinn Féin's plans to cut the Universal Social Charge (USC), claiming it would reduce tax only for people earning less than €20,000 (£15,515).
USC is a tax that was introduced in December 2010 as a temporary measure by the late finance minister, Brian Lenihan.
It was applicable to all gross incomes over €4,004 (£3,106)

John Anderson top-scored with 59 while Ed Joyce (37), William Porterfield (29) and Gary Wilson (25) also contributed on a day when 45 overs were lost.
Tanveer Ahmed and Tanwir Afzal each picked up two wickets for the tourists.
The Irish play positively, scoring at a rate of around four an over in an attempt to force a result despite the best efforts of the Belfast weather.
Joyce scored a fluent 37 from 55 balls in an opening stand of 53 with skipper Porterfield and was unluckily dismissed when he hit his wicket.
Anderson and Porterfield added a further 48 before the captain was bowled.
Niall O'Brien (15) and Paul Stirling (six) both went cheaply, but Anderson's fourth half-century for Ireland ensured they were always on top.
The Merrion man top-scored before mistiming an attempted hook shot.
Gary Wilson scored a breezy 25 and was trapped lbw two balls before the umpires decided that the light was too poor to continue.
Porterfield indicated that Ireland would bat on Friday, probably hoping to set Hong Kong a target of around 330.

===Input Doc/Src: The 72-year-old from Ramsgate, Kent, is one of seven people to have been charged with the importation offence, which has been deemed a "relatively new phenomenon" by the National Crime Agency.
But what is the scale of the problem?
More than 100 child sex dolls have been seized in the UK as part of a special operation set up by the National Crime Agency (NCA) and Border Force.
Investigators believe the dolls, which are made to be as life-like as possible, are being imported by people who have a "sexual interest" in children.
Advertised as "adult dolls" on sites including EBay and Amazon, they are manufactured in the Far East and sent to Britain via courier, fast parcel and other delivery services.
Each doll costs around Â£800, is made of a silicon-like material and weighs as much as a child.
The NCA, which set up Operation Shiraz, says paediatricians have assessed the dolls seized to be "anatomically correct".
Since March 2016, 123 dolls have been seized, destined for 120 importers.
Seven people have been charged with importation offences, two of whom, Andrew Dobson and Dean Hall, have been convicted and sentenced.
Dobson, 49 and from Crewe, was jailed for two years and eight months. He also admitted possessing indecent images of children.
Hall, 42, from Bury St Edmunds, was given a two-year suspended term. He was in also in possession of indecent images.
Hazel Stewart, operations manager for the NCA, said: "The individuals who import this type of article - child sex dolls - have a sexual interest in children and these items are an indication of that."
She said when people have been questioned by police about the dolls some have claimed they were bought for a "joke", others say they for "companionship".
"If it was a Marks and Spencer mannequin I wouldn't be stood here," she said.
Each doll is typically packed in a brown cardboard box.  It is unclothed and the head is detached from the body with the feet and hands packaged to avoid damage.

===Input Doc/Src: Leaked documents show that Sigmundur Gunnlaugsson and his wife bought offshore company Wintris in 2007.
He did not declare an interest in the company when entering parliament in 2009. He sold his 50% of Wintris to his wife for $1 (70p), eight months later.
He says no rules were broken and his wife did not benefit financially.
The offshore company was used to invest millions of dollars of inherited money, according to a document signed by Mr Gunnlaugsson's wife Anna Sigurlaug Palsdottir in 2015.
The leaked documents show that Mr Gunnlaugsson was granted a general power of attorney over Wintris - which gave him the power to manage the company "without any limitation". Ms Palsdottir had a similar power of attorney.
Court records show that Wintris had significant investments in the bonds of three major Icelandic banks that collapsed during the financial crisis which began in 2008. Wintris is listed as a creditor with millions of dollars in claims in the banks' bankruptcies.
Mr Gunnlaugsson became prime minister in 2013 and has been involved in negotiations about the banks which could affect the value of the bonds held by Wintris.
He resisted pressure from foreign creditors - including many UK customers - to repay their deposits in full.
If foreign investors had been repaid, it may have adversely affected both the Icelandic banks and the value of the bonds held by Wintris.
But Mr Gunnlaugsson kept his wife's interest in the outcome a secret.
Mr Gunnlaugsson's spokesman said his policies had put the interests of the Icelandic people ahead of the interests of the failed banks' claimants.
"The prime minister's wife's losses on these bonds issued by the failed banks will amount to hundreds of millions of Kronur and the scope for recoveries is extremely small."
The spokesman said Ms Palsdottir had always declared the assets to the tax authorities and that under the parliamentary rules Mr Gunnlaugsson did not have to declare an interest in Wintris.

Robertson said he had played some of his best snooker leading up to his Crucible defeat, which he put down to a run of misfortune.
"I said coming into the World Championship that it's probably the best season I've had to date," the 2010 world champion said.
"I've played really well, but snooker's a funny game. It's very frustrating when you don't always get the right kind of rub - you watch tennis and know if you play better than the other guy, you win.
"But that's the game we play. It can create mini-upsets. I suppose if it was the top four players in the world getting to the semis, it'd be pretty boring."
Robertson continued: "Michael played a great match - nothing really went right for me.

===Input Doc/Src: Pete Cresswell was forced to leave Liverpool University without graduating for protesting against its investments in apartheid-era South Africa.
The student was one of 10, including Channel 4 News presenter Jon Snow, punished for a six-week sit-in at the university's Senate House.
Mr Cresswell said he was "gobsmacked".
"If I went back through it 1,000 times, my 22-year-old self in 1970 would do it again," said Mr Cresswell, who was the only one of the 10 to be expelled.
The former politics student said he was "astonished" to be awarded a degree and had always thought "hell would freeze over" before the university gave him one.
Awarding him an honorary Bachelor of Arts degree at Liverpool Philharmonic Hall, vice chancellor Prof Janet Beer said "we in the university want to put this right".
She said that while the university "cannot undo" Mr Cresswell's "unfair and wrong" treatment, it can "recognise that wrong, and publicly do so" to a man who "saw what was the right thing to do and paid a price for it".
Inspired by the 1968 student revolts in France, activists across the UK brought protests and sit-ins to universities into the early 1970s and students in Liverpool were no exception.
The chancellor of the university at the time was Lord Salisbury, a known supporter of apartheid.
Mr Cresswell said: "Looking back, I think we were right and if you look at the issues, we have been proved right.
"This does put a full stop on the whole thing and I just feel pleased that a bit of history has been reviewed and put to bed."
The Birmingham-born student stayed in Liverpool and despite having to leave his politics course during his third year with a "CV from hell", eventually became a social worker, holding roles with the council and the Care Quality Commission.
Now retired, Mr Cresswell said he was pleased his daughter had had the chance to see him in robes - she graduated herself more than 10 years before him.

===Input Doc/Src: Ex-Wales striker John Hartson is concerned that the risk of injury is too great with the tournament less than a week away.
Coleman's team start their Euro 2016 campaign against Slovakia six days after their Stockholm visit, and already have several injury concerns.
"I don't think he'll take many chances with his big players," Hartson said.
"Chris has to be slightly cautious because there's only six days after Sunday until Wales open against Slovakia."
Hartson, who scored 14 goals in 51 Wales appearances, thinks that short turnaround could lead to Coleman resting Real Madrid forward Gareth Bale among others.
The world's most expensive player was last in action when he helped club side Real Madrid to win their 11th Champions League title.
"He might not play the likes of Bale, Aaron Ramsey, Joe Allen and Ashley Williams," added Hartson.
"Bale might have 10-15 minutes to shake off the cobwebs near the end maybe. I just don't think we can risk him.
"It's very close, but I don't think we can risk our big players."
Bale joined up with the Wales squad this week after his Champions League involvement.
After playing Slovakia, Wales face England in Lens on 16 June and Russia in Toulouse on 20 June.
Coleman's team is the first from Wales to qualify for the finals of a major international tournament since the 1958 World Cup.
The manager has already selected Crystal Palace's Joe Ledley who broke a bone in a leg less than a month ago.
Joe Allen and Hal Robson-Kanu are also likely to miss the Sweden clash.
"Chris has to be careful with injuries," added Hartson.
"The last thing he wants is any more injuries to deal with. He needs to make sure everyone is fit and well to play that first game in France."

Leaseholder Midcounties Co-operative has said the squatters can stay until April, despite a judge granting it permission to evict them earlier.
But owner Oxford University's Wadham College said it requires the building back by 27 February.
This is so preparations for demolition can begin, the college said, as it intends to use the site for student housing.
Neo, a spokesman for the Iffley Open House campaign group, said it was "unacceptable" for the college to try to get the squatters out by February.
He added: "The weather will still be cold, I don't want people out on the streets."
The campaigners have asked that the building, which has been empty for two years, be officially designated as homeless housing.
Kevin Brown, group general manager at the Midcounties Co-operative, said in April the company has a legal obligation to hand the site back to Wadham College.
He added: "To ensure we're able to meet that requirement, we have been granted a repossession order but our preference is not to have to use it."
A Wadham College spokesperson said: "Whilst we have deep sympathy with the plight of homeless people, any solution must not delay the redevelopment of the building as homes for students.
"We will continue our discussions with all parties in the hope of resolving this amicably and are seeking help from local homeless support groups and charities to help find longer-term accommodation for these homeless people."

===Input Doc/Src: Scientists using Europe's Cryosat radar spacecraft are now routinely mapping variations in height on a fine scale, both in time and in area.
The UK-led team's analysis shows that Greenland is shedding ice to the ocean.
Their preliminary assessment is very close to that produced from gravity satellites, which currently see losses of over 250bn tonnes of ice each year.
But while the headline numbers may be similar, Cryosat brings important additional detail to the picture.
It allows the team to study changes across the entire ice sheet at fine resolution, meaning the scientists are able to monitor the behaviour of individual glaciers.
Cryosat is also helping them to track seasonal variations in the elevation of the ice sheet, which will permit the researchers to investigate how the ice sheet changes from year to year.
"These results allow us to identify key glaciers which, in the last few years, are showing signs of rapid change," said Dr Malcolm McMillan from the NERC Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling (CPOM) at Leeds University.
The new study updates a previous assessment by the Alfred Wegener Institute, and complements existing measurements made by the US space agency's GRACE gravity satellites. These are spacecraft that can essentially "weigh" the ice sheet from orbit.
Dr McMillan and colleagues are presenting their work this week in San Francisco at the Fall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union, the largest annual gathering of Earth scientists.
Researchers have previously used space- and plane-borne laser altimeters to produce the kind of maps now coming from Cryosat.
But their data was often very sparse, making it difficult to achieve a comprehensive and up-to-date picture.
The earlier radar missions, too, struggled to get to grips with Greenland.
In part, this was because their measurement footprints were too large to really see even the biggest glaciers, but also because they were sometimes frustrated by surface conditions.

===Input Doc/Src: The Staffordshire Regiment Association said it paid Â£64,000 to buy a 10-year lease on The King's Head in Lichfield.
The regiment was founded in 1705 when Col Luke Lillingston raised a force that later became the Staffords.
Capt Dave Donnelly said: "It's brilliant. We believe we have bought a piece of history."
He said the purchase was prompted by a "mad idea" by ex-warrant officer Derek Watts, from Wolverhampton, who went on social media to drum up support.
Within a fortnight, he had managed to raise enough pledges to buy the pub.
"We have reunions in the pub annually, so we didn't want it becoming a bed and breakfast or anything like that," said Capt Donnelly.
"The support to get this off the ground has been immense. We don't know how many associations run pubs, but what is unique is that we were actually founded there."

===Input Doc/Src: Henry said the black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) community had "initiative fatigue".
"Tony Hall's announcement last week is something but with massive respect it's on an old model that doesn't work," he added.
The BBC wants to increase BAME on-air talent to one in six people by 2017.
Speaking at a culture, media and sport select committee hearing, Henry said there had been "29 initiatives at the BBC in the last 15 years and numbers (of people from BAME backgrounds working in the industry) have gone down".
He added: "Idris Elba and Chiwetel Ejiofor didn't need more training. They just needed a break."
Director general Lord Hall's announcement last Friday also included a series of targets for staff representation off-air and several other initiatives.
In addition to a Â£2.1m development fund, the BBC is bringing together a group of experts, including Henry, Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, Asian Network presenter Nihal and Lady Benjamin, to form an Independent Diversity Action Group, chaired by Lord Hall.
"I think the group will be tough-minded," Lord Hall said on Friday. "But it's good to have people who are there to support you, but also say you can do better here."
Henry was addressing the select committee during its wider review of the future of the BBC ahead of the Charter Renewal in 2016/17.
The actor and comedian wants the broadcasting industry to adopt the plan he launched at Bafta earlier this year to increase BAME representation - dubbed the Henry plan - based on the model that media watchdog Ofcom uses to classify programmes made in the nations and regions.
In response to his comments, a BBC spokesperson said: "Last week we set out far reaching plans that we believe will make a tangible difference - we will work hard to deliver them and of course reserve the option of going further if we fall short, but people should judge us on progress over the coming months and years before concluding the need for even more measures."

===Input Doc/Src: A new study tracked 72 koalas living near six wildlife crossings, specially installed by the Queensland government between 2010 and 2013.
It was the first study to test the effectiveness of the crossings, which were part of a $20 million retrofit project to help stop roadway deaths of the vulnerable marsupial.
"I was really sceptical about whether the animals would use them," says Prof Darryl Jones, a behavioural ecologist at Griffith University in Brisbane who studies the impact of roadways on wildlife.
"I have to admit straight up that I thought koalas were going to be a pretty dumb animal. They spend most of their time stoned on eucalyptus oil."
"But that's not the case. This proves they really can innovate," he says. "No koala has ever walked under a road on a ledge ever before in its evolutionary history, and indeed they were doing it within a couple of months."
"They were able to learn new tricks far faster than anyone would have thought."
The study, published in the journal Wildlife Research, used multiple technologies to track individual koalas, including cameras, GPS collars and newly-developed wireless identification chips, which communicated with devices at the entrance and exit of each crossing.
"This is going to be very influential in terms of showing accurately and reliably that the animals do use these structures," Prof Jones says.
Crossings and wildlife-proof fences were installed at hotspots where there had been continuous incidents of koalas being struck by vehicles.
While roadways still pose a threat to koalas, Prof Jones says road deaths have "almost vanished" at sites where the crossings have been installed.
Koalas are listed as vulnerable in Queensland, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, and are protected under national environment law.
In 2010, the Queensland government released a Koala Population Report, which showed there had been a 68% reduction in the local population of koalas near Brisbane over 10 years.

===Input Doc/Src: Throughout Northern Ireland's Troubles, hijackings by paramilitaries became an all too frequent occurrence for bus drivers and their passengers.
Ulsterbus, which celebrated its 50th birthday this week, had 1,500 buses destroyed during the Troubles.
However, the impact on drivers was even more severe - 12 lost their lives and many more were injured.
Ulsterbus driver Raymond Bell was hijacked five times, with three of his buses completely destroyed.
"Normally, what they did was to get someone to stand at a pedestrian crossing and as you went down the road they would have stepped onto the crossing to get you stopped," he told BBC NI's Good Morning Ulster.
"Once you stopped, all of a sudden the doors would open and there would be masked men with either cudgels or a gun and they'd say 'we're hijacking your bus'."
Mr Bell said drivers tried not to dwell on the threat because, if they did, they wouldn't have gone into work.
However, he said the incidents did have an effect.
"If you were hijacked and you weren't injured, you came back to the depot and you continued your night's work or your day's work after that," he said.
"Or the company would have said 'we'll cover your duty for you, see you tomorrow if you're able to come in'.
"Quite a lot of drivers suffered mental issues and also injuries and it stayed with them on the job and also many left the job because of issues like that."
The managing director of Ulsterbus during some of the darkest days of the Troubles was former Luftwaffe World War Two conscript Werner Heubeck.
He became famous for carrying bombs off hijacked buses.
Frank Clegg, a former colleague of Mr Heubeck, worked as general manager for services for Ulsterbus.
He said if the company didn't keep the buses running, they weren't serving the people of Northern Ireland.
"Buses represented normality - having buses on the road was lifeblood for commerce, for getting people to and from work," Mr Clegg said.
"So with all our colleagues - drivers, engineers - we ke

===Input Doc/Src: The state oil firm's technicians discovered one of the world's largest oil reserves deep beneath the seabed - under miles of layers of salt.
And then two years later, it struck gold again, finding yet another giant oil reserve.
Optimism was running high. The firm went to the markets and raised over $70bn - the world's largest share issue ever.
Brazil's economy was at cruising speed too, finally taking off after years of meagre growth.
But the good times did not last long - for neither the company nor the country. A massive corruption scandal last year eroded much of Petrobras's market value.
Brazil's economy too has been on a downward spiral - with high inflation, slow growth and low confidence.
So how did it all go so wrong, so fast?
Petrobras's oil bonanza and Brazil's emerging star status are fairly recent phenomena.
Just a few decades ago, prospects were dire for both.
In the early 1990s, Brazil was a young democracy in deep economic trouble.
Annualised inflation was running close to 5,000%. Decades of protectionism meant there was little competition in most sectors and many national firms had become inefficient.
Petrobras was seen as part of that landscape by many who wanted to privatise it.
One critic used to refer to it as "Petrossauro" - a large, outdated structure that moved slowly and was doomed to extinction in the modern world.
Brazil's fortunes started to change in the mid-1990s - both internally and externally.
Through reforms, successive governments were able to defeat hyperinflation, open up Brazil's economy to the world and redistribute growth, lifting millions out of poverty.
A decade of global economic boom favoured Brazil's champion exports - commodities like coffee, soya, beef and oil.
Brazil's oil sector was opened to foreign companies, but local laws made sure Petrobras kept its role at the top of every major project.
A decade of high international oil prices helped give a great boost to the firm's investment plans.

Speaking to the Sunday Post newspaper, Mr McFeat described how he was helped to escape "a lynch mob".
He has now been banned from Kyrgyzstan for five years.
Mr McFeat told the newspaper he actually believed the traditional Kyrgyz dish - chuchuk sausage - was a horse's penis, but the remark on Facebook angered his local colleagues.
He had been working at the Kumtor gold mine, but had to be smuggled away after the incident.
When he arrived at Manas Airport in Bishkek, he was arrested by police under race hatred laws.
Mr McFeat said: "The police told me my act could send Kyrgyzstan to war with the UK."
After appearing in court and making an apology for his remarks, Mr McFeat was put on a flight to Edinburgh.
He added: "I was told there was a 17-page petition demanding I be jailed and the mine went on strike after I left, so they were making an example of me.

===Input Doc/Src: But health officials have warned that unless MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccinations continue, a further outbreak cannot be ruled out.
There have been no laboratory-confirmed cases linked to the outbreak area since 22 May, Public Health Wales said.
One person died and a total of 1,219 measles cases were diagnosed during the outbreak since November.
Some 88 people visited a hospital due to the disease while a campaign was launched to boost the uptake of the MMR vaccine.
Dr Marion Lyons, director of health protection for Public Health Wales (PHW), said that the end of the outbreak was in "no small part to unprecedented efforts to vaccinate tens of thousands of people".
"Without so many vaccinations being given, we know that the outbreak could have continued for many more months," said Dr Lyons.
But PHW warned that with 30,000 children in the 10 to 18 years age group still unvaccinated across Wales, there was still a possibility of a further outbreak in the future.
And the health minister urged parents to get their children vaccinated.
Dr Lyons said: "The only reason this outbreak could happen was because not enough young people in Wales were fully vaccinated with two doses of MMR and there is absolutely no guarantee that this could not happen again."
Some 75,868 unscheduled vaccinations were given to people around Wales who had not been immunised in a bid to bring the epidemic under control.
GP surgeries, hospital and schools held drop-in sessions, with PHW particularly keen to target children and young people who may have missed their scheduled jabs.
Health Minister Mark Drakeford said he "wholeheartedly" welcomed the end of the outbreak but insisted there was "still work to do".
"The young people in the 10 to 18 age group who still have not been vaccinated should make the necessary arrangements at their earliest convenience," he added.

===Input Doc/Src: The Labour leader said the "misery" that those travelling to London had faced made a "very good case" for a change of ownership.
Southern passengers have faced delays, cancellations and a reduced timetable amid staff shortages and strikes.
The operator is in a dispute with the RMT union over the role of guards.
Two days of talks aimed at averting a five-day strike by the union are due to begin later at the conciliation service Acas.
Southern has promised to run 60% of its normal timetable if the strike, due to begin on Monday, goes ahead.
The company is also facing fresh strike action after the TSSA union said it would be balloting workers in a dispute over ticket office closures.
"I want to see Southern back in public ownership. I don't believe it's fulfilling its obligations under the franchise it was given, " Mr Corbyn said at a leadership rally in Brighton.
He said that it was a "enormous mistake" not to take all the train operating franchises back into public ownership after the 2001 collapse of the company then running the network, Railtrack, and he re-stated his commitment to renationalise each train service as its contract expires.
At the rally, Mr Corbyn also said the government should have intervened to prevent the financial difficulties at the retailer BHS, which went into administration in April.
Earlier, Mr Corbyn said he was disappointed at an attack on him by David Blanchflower, an economist who has resigned from the committee advising the shadow chancellor John McDonnell.
Mr Blanchflower said Mr Corbyn had no credible economic policy and was more interested in addressing rallies than leading the party to power.
Mr Corbyn said: "I'm disappointed because he was helping us, we were developing and are continuing to develop a very strong and very credible economic policy which is about dealing with inequality in Britain and the need for investment in Britain by the promotion of a National Investment Bank."

===Input Doc/Src: Mosaab, his wife Nada and their three children are getting used to life in Scotland.
They are among hundreds of Syrian people who fled the war and have started new lives with refugee status.
The BBC has agreed not to use their surnames because they fear speaking out may put their family members still in Syria at risk.
Mosaab was a tiler and self-employed lorry driver in Syria. Before the war, he says life was good, living together in peace. They would take trips to the coast and go to the countryside to pick olives straight from the tree.
"I lost friends in the war, our house was destroyed and I was fleeing from place to place looking for a shelter, " he says.

The woman charged - 25-year-old Nisreen Assad Ibrahim Bahar, known as Umm Sayyaf -  is currently in Iraqi custody.
Prosecutors say Sayyaf kept Ms Mueller captive, allowing her to be repeatedly raped by IS chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
Nisreen Bahar's husband, Abu Sayyaf, is described in an affidavit as IS minister for oil and gas, reporting directly to Baghdadi.
Abu Sayyaf died last May when his compound in Syria was raided by US special forces.
His widow was handed over to the Iraqi authorities for prosecution.

Accies survived some nervous moments before Ash Taylor headed the Dons ahead after 34 minutes.
But the lead only lasted four minutes as Dougie Imrie scored from the penalty spot after Danny Redmond was challenged by goalkeeper Joe Lewis.
Rooney pounced when Gary Woods parried a James Maddison shot, before Accies' Scott McMann was shown a late red card.
The win - thanks to the Irish striker's 11th goal this season - takes Aberdeen to within four points of second-placed Rangers in the Scottish Premiership table.
Accies remain second bottom without a victory in 10 games since beating the Dons in October.
Aberdeen were fluid and dangerous from the off, exposing Accies' weakness on the left flank, with Louis Longridge inexperienced in a full-back role against Jonny Hayes.
Mark Reynolds netted early on, but referee Andrew Dallas saw pushing and ruled it out, perhaps a touch harshly as the Dons defender didn't appear to be the culprit.
It seemed only a matter of time for the home side, with visiting defenders struggling to cope with the recurring threat.
One corner in particular caused chaos involving a Reynolds header that was saved, an overhead kick clearance and a follow up effort from Andrew Considine with the ball eventually forced behind.
Chances and corners flowed. Perhaps one criticism that could be levelled at Aberdeen was how they had not managed to score before they did.
The breakthrough came from a set piece. Hayes floated a great free-kick to Taylor, whose header was equally accurate and found the corner.
Incredibly, Hamilton were almost immediately handed a route back into the match.
Taylor blundered to let Redmond in on Lewis, who appeared to hesitate, allowing the midfielder to nick the ball.
The goalkeeper got a touch on the ball, but it was not clear whether he had taken the man first. No matter, the referee gave the penalty, which Imrie fired home confidently.
Aberdeen responded well to that set-back, with W

===Input Doc/Src: Official documents obtained by Reuters news agency show government lawyers advised the US it might be considered a co-belligerent under international law.
The Obama administration has continued to authorise weapons sales to Saudi Arabia despite the warnings last year.
On Saturday, an air strike on a funeral hall in Sanaa killed some 140 people.
The coalition denied responsibility for the attack, but Washington said it would review its support to "better align with US principles, values and interests".
US President Barack Obama agreed to provide "logistical and intelligence support" to the coalition after it intervened in the conflict between forces loyal to Yemen's internationally-recognised government and those allied to the rebel Houthi movement in March 2015.
Since then, more than 4,125 civilians have been killed and 7,207 injured, the UN says, with air strikes believed to have caused about 60% of the deaths.
The documents detailing US government concerns about the civilian casualties and the potential legal implications for US military personnel were obtained by Reuters under the Freedom of Information Act and date from May 2015 to February 2016.
One document quotes a state department official as telling human rights groups in October 2015 that he believed coalition strikes were "not intentionally indiscriminate but rather result from a lack of Saudi experience with dropping munitions and firing missiles".
"The lack of Saudi experience is compounded by the asymmetric situation on the ground where enemy militants are not wearing uniforms and are mixed with civilian populations," the official said.
"Weak intelligence likely further compounds the problem," he added.

The ultimate childhood tennis dream had been realised in one perfect draw - a Wimbledon wildcard leading to the British teenager facing the legendary Martina Navratilova on Centre Court.
It was 1994 and set to be nine-time champion Navratilova's farewell appearance in singles at the All England Club.
World number 360 Taylor, then 19, was steadily climbing the rankings, had just beaten a player in the top 50 at Eastbourne and would normally have had the unwavering support of the home crowd.
But ruining a legend's day would not have gone down well.
"When we came out they gave her a standing ovation for what seemed like forever, so I stood at the net like a doughnut waiting for her," Taylor, now Claire Shepherd after marrying Dean in 2013, told BBC Sport.
"It didn't stop; it was incredible. I was just stood there and the umpire said: 'It's OK, this doesn't normally happen.'
"The crowd were definitely pro-Martina, but they were still supportive of me.
"It is just a bit of a regret that my career highlight was losing a match. I don't like that really, but it was Martina on Centre Court."
Now a tennis coach, Shepherd, 42, is still very much in love with the sport and remains a regular visitor to SW19, having been hooked long before she became Oxfordshire county champion at the age of 10.
She used go to the All England Club with her tennis-mad father Phil and join the queuing masses to get tickets, so being out on the showpiece court in front of millions watching on television felt "very strange".
The Banbury-born left-hander had made her Wimbledon debut in the ladies' doubles in 1993. But this was something else.
"We had queued many times to watch Martina so to play her was amazing," the former British number two added. "My first thought was: 'Wow, that's great.' Then, it was: 'No hold on, that's a terrible draw.'"

===Input Doc/Src: Based on the novel by Britain's Mark Burnell, The Rhythm Section will see her as a woman who becomes an assassin to avenge the deaths of her family.
Reed Morano, who directed the first three episodes of hit TV series The Handmaid's Tale, will direct the film.
Bond producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson said it was "exciting" to work with such a "talented" team.
Morano and Lively, they added, "have a strong vision for this very compelling story driven by a female protagonist".
The Rhythm Section is the first of four novels to feature Burnell's Stephanie Patrick heroine, inviting the prospect of a Bond-style film series.
Its announcement comes during a hiatus in production on the James Bond films, which Broccoli and Wilson have co-produced since 1995.
Production on the film will begin later this year, with financing from international production company IM Global.
Its head Stuart Ford said the film would be "fresh, realistic and bold", with "a unique female heroine who turns so many of the current cinematic cliches surrounding so-called 'kick-ass' female leads on their head".
Lively, who is married to Deadpool star Ryan Reynolds, is also known for playing the ageless heroine of the film The Age of Adeline.
Last year saw her battle a shark in The Shallows, appear in Woody Allen's Cafe Society and also give birth to her second child.

===Input Doc/Src: The second-tier club, located just east of capital city Brussels, narrowly avoided relegation this season.
The club's board set a time limit in its search for investment and said King Power "was the only bidder who made a clear and coherent proposal".
Its directors said the deal "guarantees the future of the club, both financially and in sporting terms".
OH Leuven were relegated from Belgium's top tier in 2015-16 but said new ownership would provide "sufficient financial resources to aspire to the earliest possible return".
It added King Power - founded by Leicester chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha in 1989 - will fund an expansion of the club's youth system.
The acquisition will be formally completed when the company has concluded due diligence.
Srivaddhanaprabha is worth an estimated £3.6bn according to Forbes.
The 58-year-old bought Leicester in 2010, with the club winning promotion to the top flight four years later and claiming the Premier League title in 2015-16.
---Sum/Tgt: Leicester City owners King Power International have agreed to purchase OH Leuven, the Belgian club says.

===Input Doc/Src: Matip, 25, was named in Cameroon's preliminary squad for this month's Africa Cup of Nations, but the defender said he did not want to play.
He would have been in the squad, maybe on the pitch so I don't think it's fair
He was not in the final 23-man squad, but the Reds are seeking "clarity" from Fifa about his availability.
Germany-born Matip has not featured for Cameroon since September 2015.
Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp said: "In our understanding, Joel is officially retired from international football.
"The club did everything we had to do to make this clear, but up until now we couldn't get the response we need to be 100% sure he can play.
"It's pretty difficult and really frustrating. He has been in training four or five days. He would have been in the squad, maybe on the pitch [against United] so I don't think it's fair."
Matip was one of seven of their players who said they did not want to play at the tournament in Gabon, which started on Saturday and runs until 5 February.
Another, West Brom full-back Allan Nyom, also failed to received international clearance and did not feature in his side's 4-0 defeat at Tottenham on Saturday.
The Cameroon football association (Fecafoot) can ask world governing body Fifa to suspend those players at club level for the duration of the event.
Liverpool said Fecafoot has failed to confirm whether centre-back Matip - who has made 12 Premier League appearances since moving to Anfield from German side Schalke in the summer - can continue to play club football.
---Sum/Tgt: Liverpool withdrew Joel Matip from their squad to face Manchester United on Sunday because they are unsure about his international clearance.

===Input Doc/Src: In his Autumn Statement Philip Hammond said growth predictions had been cut as a result of the Brexit vote.
As widely expected, he unveiled a fuel duty freeze and more cash for housing, transport and digital infrastructure.
Labour said the government was "unprepared and ill-equipped" for Brexit and had "no vision".
Mr Hammond told MPs the UK's deficit would no longer be cleared by 2020 - with the target instead "as early as possible" afterwards.
Mr Hammond said the statement - his first major Commons event as chancellor - came exactly five months after a Brexit vote which "will change the course of Britain's history", making it "more urgent than ever" to tackle long-term economic weaknesses.
Presenting the Office for Budget Responsibility's forecasts, he said borrowing would hit £68.2bn this year and £59bn next year, compared with the March forecast of £55.5bn and £38.8bn.
The OBR said the referendum result meant potential growth in the current Parliament would be 2.4 percentage points lower than forecast in March. Government finances are forecast to be £122bn worse off than in the spring.
Among the chancellor's announcements were:
Mr Hammond said the government would prioritise "additional high-value investment" on infrastructure, which would be funded by additional borrowing.
He paid tribute to his predecessor George Osborne but said he would now follow three new fiscal rules: to balance the books "as early as possible in the next Parliament", for public sector net debt to be falling as a share of GDP by the end of Parliament and for welfare spending to be within a cap.
The OBR based its forecasts on the assumption that the UK would leave the EU in April 2019 - two years after the government's deadline for triggering negotiations with Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty.
It also assumed new trading arrangements would slow import and export growth for a decade and that migration would be restricted.
It said the increased borrowing would result from weak tax receipts an

===Input Doc/Src: Russell, 28, was part of the side that won April's World Twenty20 and will be available for four matches in June.
Tahir, 37, will then link up for the final seven games and is set to play in six County Championship fixtures.
"Andre is one of the leading T20 players in the world right now," said director of cricket Mick Newell.
Russell has taken 180 wickets in T20 cricket at an average of 26.13, and has 12 half-centuries with the bat with a strike rate of more than 165 runs per 100 balls.
Newell added: "Looking at our line-up, there was certainly scope to add a hitter into the middle order, as we did in 2015 with Darren Sammy.
"In Andre's case it's an added bonus that he's a very effective fast bowler as well."
Tahir played three matches for Notts towards the end of last season.
He has taken 150 wickets in international and domestic T20 cricket at 20.82, with an economy rate below seven.
"We've seen many times how valuable a world-class leg-spinner can be, in all formats of the game," said Newell.
"Imran enjoyed his time here last year, he wanted to come back, and we're only too happy for him to do so.
"Having him available will also allow us to make the most of some of the drier pitches in four-day cricket at the back end of the summer."

===Input Doc/Src: Officers are investigating whether one of the men fell from a 12th floor balcony of the 19-storey Donside Court, in the Tillydrone area of the city.
Emergency services were called to the building at about 20:15 on Tuesday evening.
A witness has described hearing a woman screaming "help me, help me" before police arrived.
Police Scotland said it believed the incident was contained and there was not a threat to the wider community.
A blue forensics tent had been erected inside a police cordon at the foot of the building, close to the main entrance.
An eyewitness said they saw a man fall from the 12th floor of the building, which police confirmed they were pursuing as a line of inquiry.
Another witness, Toni Dey, 19, who lives a short distance away in Gordon's Mills Road, said she heard screaming from the block.
The mother of two said: "I heard some girl screaming 'Help me, help me', then about 10 minutes after I heard loads of screaming and shouting.
"I didn't call the police as I thought it was kids messing around, then I heard loads of police.
"It's very scary to think that something like that had happened. All I kept thinking was 'Why was that poor girl shouting help me?', and about a two-minute walk out my back door.
"I just moved in here in May and it's been so quiet. I was shocked to hear anything as I never normally do."
Another woman told BBC Scotland that she had known one of the men involved, describing him as a "nice boy".
Det Supt Dave McLaren said further information about the incident would be released in due course.
"At this time the investigation is in its very early stages," he said.
"However, the circumstances as they present at this time would indicate that this is a contained incident and we are not looking for any other person in relation to the deaths."
Police dismissed reports on social media that a police officer had been injured and said there was no suggestion the incident was terrorism-related.

===Input Doc/Src: The five were a 16-year-old girl, who died in Great Victoria Street on Monday, and four men who died in different parts of the city.
Police did not confirm which three cases are suspected to be drugs-related but no single, common drug is involved.
Earlier, a senior officer said all five deaths may have involved drugs.
But a Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) spokeswoman later clarified that detectives suspect drug misuse may have been a factor in only three of the deaths.
Post-mortem examinations are being carried out and toxicology reports have been ordered.
The first of the five sudden deaths took place in Verner Street in Belfast city centre on Friday, 31 March.
The other four people, including the teenaged girl, all died on Monday:
Police said that number of deaths in such a short time frame was unusual, but that they were not linking any of them at present.
Ch Supt Tim Mairs said: "Investigations are at an early stage, but I would like to take the opportunity to reinforce the dangers posed by taking any illegal drugs or any medication that is not prescribed for you.
"Drugs misuse can affect anyone and we recognise that many vulnerable people are being exploited for the financial gain of those higher up the supply chain."
He added: "The number of deaths in Northern Ireland connected to drug use is on the increase and this is a concern.
"Sadly, these are all preventable. In fact, more people are dying from misuse of opioid drugs in Northern Ireland than in road fatalities, which is a very stark reality."

He was detained as part of an intelligence-led operation after a concerned family member is believed to have contacted the police.

It comes after a warrant of further detention was granted at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Wednesday.

===Input Doc/Src: Chief prosecutor Tomas Lindstrand said police were "98% sure" that the man was Iraq-born Taimour Abdulwahab al-Abdaly.
Abdaly, 28, is believed to have died minutes after setting off a car bomb on Saturday. Two other people were hurt.
Seven US FBI bomb experts are heading to Stockholm to help the investigation, Sweden's intelligence agency said.
Although Abdaly was a Swedish citizen, he had been living in the UK.
British police have been searching a house in Luton, north of London, where Abdaly lived.
Mr Lindstrand said Swedish police were now trying to work out what the bomber's target had been before he blew himself up prematurely.
"He had a bomb belt on him, he had a backpack with a bomb and he was carrying an object that has been compared to a pressure cooker. If it had all blown up at the same time, it would have been very powerful," he said.
A car containing gas canisters blew up first in a busy shopping street in the area of Drottninggatan at 1700 local time (1600 GMT) followed minutes later by a explosion in a street about 300m (985ft) away that killed the bomber.
Abdaly was named as the registered owner of the car.
Mr Lindstrand said they believed the bomber had intended to kill "as many people as possible".
"Where he was headed... we don't know," he said.
"It is likely that something happened, that he made some kind of mistake [and] part of the bombs he was carrying went off and caused his death.
"This was during Christmas shopping in central Stockholm and he was extremely well-equipped when it came to bomb material. It is not much of a stretch to say he was going to a place with as many people as possible."
Mr Lindstrand said possible targets included the city's central train station or to Aahlens, a popular department store.
In a profile on the Muslim dating website Muslima, Abdaly said he was born in Baghdad and moved to Sweden in 1992, before arriving in the UK in 2001 to study.
He said he had got married in 2004 and had two young daughters.

===Input Doc/Src: Chelsea Manning, whose sentence was commuted by the outgoing president, thanked him "for giving me a chance".
The 29-year-old transgender soldier, born Bradley Manning, gave embarrassing documents to Wikileaks in 2010.
At President Obama's final press conference on Wednesday, he declared that "justice has been served".
She will be freed from the Fort Leavenworth military prison in May - 29 years ahead of her scheduled release in 2045.
Wikileaks founder Julian Assange weighed in on Thursday, insisting that he would stand by his offer to be extradited to the US as long as his rights were protected.
Mr Assange, who agreed to be extradited to the US if Mr Obama granted clemency to Manning, has been holed up at the Ecuadorian embassy in London since 2012.
The Australian national sought refuge there to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he is wanted for questioning in relation to an alleged sex offence.
"I stand by everything I said including the offer to go to the United States if Chelsea Manning's sentence was commuted," he said in a live online audio news conference on Thursday.
"It's not going to be commuted (until) May. We can have many discussions to that point," he added.
The White House said Manning's commutation had not been influenced in any way by Mr Assange's offer, and the US justice department has not indicted Mr Assange nor publicly sought his extradition.
Obama says justice is served
Viewpoint: Obama got it right
Mr Obama's last-minute commutation quickly drew criticism from Republican circles.
A spokesman for president-elect Donald Trump said he "is troubled by this action. It's disappointing and it sends a very troubling message when it comes to the handling of classified information".
Republican Speaker of the House Paul Ryan called the decision "outrageous".
"Chelsea Manning's treachery put American lives at risk and exposed some of our nation's most sensitive secrets," Mr Ryan said.

===Input Doc/Src: The White Rabbit, the Cheshire Cat and Alice all feature in artist Grahame Baker-Smith's illustrations.
The story was made up by Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, a young don at Christ Church in Oxford, to entertain children on a boat trip in 1862.
It was published under Dodgson's pseudonym, Lewis Carroll, three years later.
One of the children on the Thames boat trip was Alice Liddel, the daughter of the dean of the college.
Alice later asked for the story, originally entitled Alice's Adventures Under Ground, to be written down. Dodgson did so as a Christmas gift in 1864 with his own illustrations.
It went on to become one of the best known works in children's literature, with numerous TV and film adaptations.
The stamps feature famous scenes from the book including the Mad Hatter's tea party and Alice falling down the rabbit hole.
Illustrator Grahame Baker-Smith said he had based the images of Alice on the stamps on his own daughter.
"The most difficult thing was consistency and working on such a very small scale. They all have to work as a set, so you want to have a range of colour and tone across the 10 stamps.
"The Royal Mail has a rich history of illustration on stamps, so the chance to have a go at that is a great opportunity."
Andrew Hammond, Royal Mail director of stamps and collectibles, said: "The story of Alice in Wonderland remains a perennial favourite of children, and indeed adults, around the world.
"It is fitting that in its 150th anniversary year it is celebrated with a wonderful set of stamps featuring striking images that do justice to such an iconic tale."

===Input Doc/Src: Pleas for leniency from the inmates, families and diplomats were rejected by President Joko Widodo.
But the execution of a Filipina who was also on death row was unexpectedly postponed.
Another death row convict, a Frenchmen, was not executed because he still has an outstanding legal complaint over the rejection of his clemency appeal.
Who are the prisoners and how did they end up on death row?
Sukumaran, 34, was an Australian citizen, born in London. In 2006, a court in Bali found him guilty of being the ringleader of the Bali Nine - a group of Australians arrested in Bali with more than 18lb (8.3kg) of heroin.
He was given the death penalty in 2006, and his plea for clemency was rejected in December 2014.
His advocates claimed he had reformed since entering prison, teaching other inmates English and art. He also became an accomplished artist himself. However, all attempts to appeal against his sentence failed.
Chan, 31, was an Australian who was given the death penalty along with Myuran Sukumaran.
He was arrested in Ngurah Rai airport in Bali in April 2005. A court found him guilty of planning the smuggling of 18lb heroin with the group known as the Bali Nine.
His plea for clemency was rejected in January 2015. Like Sukumaran, other legal challenges all failed.
His supporters claimed he had turned over a new leaf and and ran Bible study classes in Bali's Kerobokan jail.
There is some confusion surrounding Anderson's nationality. Initial reports said he was Ghanaian, but it was later reported he had travelled to Indonesia on a false passport and was in fact Nigerian.
He was arrested in Jakarta in 2003, and a court gave him the death penalty. His clemency appeal was rejected in January 2015.
Badarudin was the only Indonesian citizen amongst the group. He was born in Palembang and was found guilty of the possession of 129lb of marijuana.

===Input Doc/Src: His journey towards the Rio 2016 Paralympic Games as a para-canoeist has been one filled with life-changing obstacles and defined by a steely resolve.
He began as a record-breaking junior world champion powerlifter. Then, after suffering a serious spinal injury, he embarked on an illustrious handcycling career.
Marsden raced on the European circuit while based in the Czech Republic, before a neck problem again saw him admitted into the University Hospital of North Staffordshire in 2009 for what he thought was a prolapsed disc.
Instead it was revealed that he suffers with a rare motor-neurone condition which affects his arms, legs and brain.
"Through powerlifting I damaged my back many years ago, and after that I managed to damage my neck and had a couple of plates and (carbon) cage put in," the 44-year-old from Stoke-on-Trent told BBC East Midlands Today.
In a matter-of-fact manner, Marsden says his sporting journey "has not been an easy one".
When handcycling was no longer an option, he took up air rifle shooting and set his sights on London 2012, but while more representative honours came his way, he missed out on the Paralympics.
Eventually, he turned to the water where he was able to combine aspects of his his first two sporting loves - powerlifting and handcycling - together in one explosive sport.
"I didn't want to give up on sport," he said. "The cycling and powerlifting work quite well with the para-canoe - the gym work, the power and strength and then you have the endurance and speed work on the bike."
The two-time para-canoe European champion and two-time world silver medallist now wants to realise his Paralympic ambition in Brazil when the British line-up is decided at the trials in Nottingham in June.
"It would be the highlight of my sporting career," Marsden said.

"I suppose it was all the ideas I had, they were so different and there were so many of them," she enthuses.
"I did a lot of market research and the response I got was, 'Yes that's great, we'd sell that.' So I progressed from there."

Zandra is already exporting to South Africa, Dubai and Singapore and has her eye on cracking the US market. She buys in expertise, when needed, including a marketing expert and an export adviser.
She loves the flexibility of being self-employed.
"I can work at midnight if I want to, I can take a longer lunch if I want to - especially when the weather is good - and I can make the time up later. I just love it, I love all of it. It's fun."
Self-employment is one of the big stories of the recovery. One in seven workers in the UK are now working for themselves.

In fact, there are now 780,000 more people in employment than there were this time last year, and 40% of those are self-employed.
Over the longer term, the biggest rise in self-employment has been seen in the number of older workers. According to the ONS, self-employment among the over-50s is up 36% on 10 years ago.

===Input Doc/Src: On Monday, Rick Maddison fatally shot Senior Constable Brett Forte after the police officer intercepted his car in Queensland.
He fled to a nearby farmhouse and spent the night in a stand-off with police.
Maddison was killed by authorities after fleeing the house and firing on police, Queensland Police Assistant Commissioner Tony Wright said.
"He has been challenged by police at that point in time - he has fired at those police," he told reporters on Tuesday.
"Specialist police have returned fire. The male person has been shot and that male person has been declared deceased at the scene."
Mr Forte was killed after intercepting Maddison, who police had described as a "wanted person", about 14:20 local time (04:20 GMT) on Monday.
Authorities had set up an exclusion zone around the farm and began negotiating with Maddison at midnight.
The confrontation happened just after 11:00.
On Monday, Queensland Police Commissioner Ian Stewart said he wanted to resolve the siege "as peacefully as humanly possible".
Residents nearby residents were ordered to evacuate their homes on Monday evening.
Mr Forte was a husband and father who had been a police officer for more than 15 years, authorities said.
"It is so distressing - not just to the police service - but to the community, that we have lost a fine police officer," Mr Stewart said.
Queensland Police Union president Ian Leavers said the officer was shot "simply trying to apprehend a wanted person".
"It could have been any one of us anywhere in Australia," he told the Seven Network.

===Input Doc/Src: Rod Mackenzie, described as a life-long crofter, was one of six commissioners elected in March and represents the East Highlands.
Mr Ewing said the appointment would bring stability to the Crofting Commission.
The regulatory body had been involved in a lengthy row that saw calls for the last convener to resign.
Earlier this year, Scottish ministers urged for action to address "worrying failures" indentified by a review of the commission.
The review ordered by the government found "personality clashes" amid issues with management at the organisation.
Crofting is carried out in the Highlands, Northern and Western Isles and Argyll.
Mr Ewing said: "As a life-long crofter, Mr Mackenzie will bring a wealth of knowledge and experience to the role and I look forward to working collaboratively with him in the future.
"With the appointment of the new convener, the creation of the new board of commissioners and the recruitment of a new chief executive earlier this year, I believe crofting can look forward to a period of stability and a positive focus on issues that will greatly improve the lives of those living in remote and rural areas."
Mr Mackenzie said he was delighted to be selected for the role.
He said: "We've had several meetings of the board of commissioners since the elections in March, both for business and for training as a new group coming together and I've been impressed by just that - how everyone wants to come together, to do a good job for crofting.
"And what I've quickly learnt is that it is no simple thing. As a public regulator, you are working within constraints - there's no magic wand.
"But what there is, is the will to work together to make a difference."

And despite playing Johnny Speight's infamous creation for such a long time, he managed to avoid being typecast as Britain's favourite bigot.
Warren Mitchell was actually born as Warren Misell on 14 January 1926 in north London.
His father, Monty, was English, while his mother Annie, who died when he was 15, was of Russian descent.
He was chosen, aged five, to play Tiny Tim in his primary school's production of A Christmas Carol but never made the stage.
His Orthodox Jewish grandmother vetoed the idea when she learned he would be breaking Jewish dietary law by eating Christmas pudding containing suet.
In later years he developed a pathological loathing of Christmas, referring to it as "all that sentimental crap".
However, his interest in acting grew and, at the age of seven, he was enrolled in Gladys Gordon's Academy of Dramatic Arts in Walthamstow, east London.
He also developed a love of football, becoming a staunch supporter of Tottenham Hotspur.
He did well at school and went on to read physical chemistry at University College, Oxford, where he met Richard Burton, who encouraged his interest in acting.
They joined the RAF together in 1944 and Mitchell was sent to Canada to train as a navigator, although the war ended before he saw active service.
Mitchell enrolled for a two-year course at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, spending his evenings performing with the left-wing Unity Theatre in London, where he met his wife, Connie.
Because she was an Anglican, Mitchell's Jewish father initially refused to have Connie in the house, but he eventually came round to the idea of his son marrying outside his faith.
Mitchell was an atheist for most of his life and a keen supporter of the British Humanist Association.
He changed his name in 1951 when he stood in for the DJ Pete Murray a

===Input Doc/Src: The Federal Anti-Monopoly Service (Fas) said that Apple's local subsidiary told 16 retailers to maintain the recommended prices of phones in the iPhone 5 and iPhone 6 families.
Non-compliance with the pricing guidelines may have led to the termination of contracts, it found.
Apple has not yet responded to a request for comment.
At the time of the investigation, Apple denied that it controlled its products' pricing, telling Reuters that resellers "set their own prices for the Apple products they sell in Russia and around the world".
The regulator said Apple had now ended its price-fixing practices but has not said whether the company faces a fine.
The FAS claimed that Apple Rus monitored the retail prices for the iPhone 5c, 5s, 6, 6 Plus, 6s and 6s Plus.
"In the case of the establishment of 'inappropriate' prices, the Russian subsidiary of Apple sent emails to resellers asking them to change," the watchdog said.
The deputy head of the FAS, Andrey Tsarikovsky, added that "Apple actively co-operated" with the investigation and that the company had "adopted the necessary measures to eliminate violations of the law".
That included training employees in the "anti-monopoly legislation norms" in Russia.
In May, the FAS found that Google used its dominant position to force its own apps and services on users and fined it Â£5m ($6m).
And, in November, the regulator opened an investigation into whether Microsoft abused its position in the security market with Windows 10, following a complaint from Moscow-based anti-virus firm Kaspersky.

===Input Doc/Src: Shamas Ali, 47, forced the youngster to massage him and touch his legs before carrying out sex acts.
Ali had denied the indecency offence committed at houses in Dunfermline but was found guilty by a majority verdict at the High Court in Edinburgh.
He was found guilty of abusing the girl when she was aged between seven and 11, up to August 2003.
The victim, now aged 22, gave evidence against Ali, who is from Dunfermline.
Defence solicitor advocate John Scott QC asked that Ali's bail be continued after the verdict.
He said Ali had no criminal record of any significance and no breaches of bail.
Mr Scott said: "Whilst a custodial sentence is all but inevitable, there is no reason to think he would fail to comply with bail conditions."
The judge told Ali: "You have been convicted of a serious sexual offence."
Lady Wise said she was prepared to continue his bail while a background report was prepared ahead of sentencing next month.
But she told Ali: "You should not be under any illusion that says anything about the ultimate disposal."
Ali was placed on the sex offenders' register.

Thursday's election ended the unionist majority at Stormont, with Sinn Féin now just one seat behind the DUP.
Talks are being held to restore the power-sharing executive, but parties have just three weeks to reach a deal.
The five main party leaders have held a series of bilateral talks on Tuesday, as well as separate discussions with Mr Brokenshire.
Sinn Féin said it had further discussions with the secretary of state regarding money for inquests into the most controversial killings of the Troubles but that he had come to "no good conclusion".
"Some families have been waiting 45 years and this affects all victims, regardless of the perpetrators," said party leader Gerry Adams.
"They need to get those inquests under way and they have been delayed because the British refuse to give the funds."
The party also met with the DUP and further meetings were planned, said Mr Adams. He added this was an indication that issues were being tackled.
Meanwhile, the head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, Sir Malcolm McKibbin, said one of the most difficult issues facing the administration was the absence of a budget to cover the financial year from next month.
Sir Malcolm said there was a "small window of opportunity" to allow a new executive to agree a budget and put it to the Assembly.
On Tuesday morning, DUP leader Arlene Foster met her party's freshly elected MLAs (members of the legislative assembly) and said she was "delighted" with their support.
"We have had an excellent group meeting where we had a full and open discussion around the election campaign, the result and, of course, the negotiations that are going on at the moment," she said.

The UK Scout Association said the on-site medical team and local paramedics "rendered immediate support but unfortunately were unable to save him".
Spokesman Simon Carter said it was in touch with the families of the children at the jamboree, which more than 16,000 people are attending.
"We will be working with the Finnish Scout movement and the relevant local authorities to establish the full details of this tragic incident," he added.
More than 2,800 scouts from more than 40 countries are attending the jamboree in the south of Finland.
Memorial services have been held at the event in tribute to Charlie.
Anna Munsterhjelm, chief scout in Finland, said: "The Guides and Scouts of Finland and Finnjamboree Roihu express their deepest condolences to the friends and family of the tragic medical situation that resulted in the death of a scout.
"The loss has moved thousands of people within and outside the camp.
"The camp has professional crisis counsellors that are making their utmost best that everybody has the support they require." (sic)
Charlie had been a Year 7 pupil at Maplesden Noakes School, in Maidstone.
Head teacher Jane Prideaux said staff were "deeply shocked and saddened" by his death.
"He'd been with us for just a year," she said.

===Input Doc/Src: Twenty-five international artists were sent debris from the Mackintosh library, which was gutted by fire in May 2014.
The work they created will be sold at auction to raise money for the Mackintosh Campus Appeal.
It is hoped £32m can be raised.
Other artists taking part include Grayson Perry, Cornelia Parker, Jenny Saville, David Shrigley and Douglas Gordon as well as The Chapman Brothers and Sir Peter Blake, with seven Turner prize winners among them.
Each artist was sent a piece of material specifically chosen for them with a note telling them what it was, where it was from and explaining the concept of the auction.
Perry, who has made an urn featuring the words "Art is dead. Long live Art", said: "It's a tragedy. It's the most famous art school building in Britain.
"It's also the masterpiece of Mackintosh. It's a double tragedy.
"I was very excited when I received the box of charcoal. I had an idea almost immediately and the idea of making an urn was an obvious thing to do.
"The idea of memorialising or celebrating the difficulty - honouring the wound. It's something I'm trying to do. Move on and make the most of it.
"I really like the idea of using the charcoal from the fire. I thought it was very clever. It's also fresh - it's not something that has come up before.
"We've all been asked to do T-shirts, knickers and mugs - endless charity rounds. I get about two a week."
The project, titled Ash To Art, was created by communications agency J. Walter Thompson London in collaboration with The Glasgow School of Art Development Trust.
The work will be on display at Christie's in London's King Street from 3-7 March and will be auctioned during the Post-War and Contemporary Art Day Sale on 8 March.

===Input Doc/Src: The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority said there appeared to be no "material" reason to alter its proposal, first put forward in 2013.
Unless "new evidence" emerged, MPs' pay will rise from £67,060 to £74,000.
David Cameron opposes the move but has said he will not block the increase, saying MPs' pay is a matter for Ipsa.
Ipsa was handed control of decisions over MPs' pay and expenses in the wake of the 2009 expenses scandal. It does not need to get the agreement of Parliament to bring in the changes.
The UK's 650 MPs are currently paid £67,060. Their pay would rise to £74,000 under Ipsa's final plans.
The PM has previously urged the watchdog to scrap the above-inflation increase, which was initially proposed to address complaints that pay had fallen behind the rest of the public sector.
But in its final consultation on the proposals, Ipsa restated its intention to press ahead with the increase, saying there appeared to be no "material" reason to change the recommendations.
Unless "new and compelling evidence" emerged by the end of June the pay rise - to be backdated to 8 May - would be confirmed, it said.
Ipsa said that due to cuts in pensions and expenses - such as a ban on claiming for evening meals - the overall package of changes would not cost taxpayers "a penny more".
Ministers are set to benefit from the increase to MPs' pay - as only the government element of their salaries has been frozen for five years under plans announced by David Cameron in the wake of the Conservatives' election victory.
Commenting on the final proposals, the PM's spokeswoman said: "Throughout this process and debate, the prime minister has been absolutely clear that he doesn't agree with the proposed increase.
"But ultimately it is up to Ipsa as an independent body to decide MPs' pay and it is for them to make their determination."

Mr Cabello dismissed the accusations, saying no proof had been offered.
In March the US imposed sanctions on a group of Venezuelan officials.
Venezuelan opposition leaders and US officials have previously made similar accusations against the governments of President Nicolas Maduro and his predecessor Hugo Chavez.
Mr Cabello is both president of the National Assembly and the second most senior official in the governing Socialist Party.
Last month he filed a defamation suit against 22 people linked to various media outlets who had republished details of the US accusations.
Correspondents say he sees the accusations as part of a campaign to discredit the country's socialist achievements and to destabilise it months before a parliamentary election.
The US has sanctioned at least 50 Venezuelan government officials whom it accuses of drug-trafficking and human rights abuses.
In December, President Barack Obama signed a decree classifying Venezuela as a "security threat".

Three Syrian rebel groups have expressed doubts to the BBC over the cessation of hostilities agreement:

World media on Syria plan
Agreement to try to bring about a cessation of hostilities and allow more access for humanitarian aid was reached by world powers late on Thursday in Germany, but neither the Syrian government nor the rebels were involved.
So far there has been no sign of the UN realising its hopes of delivering aid imminently to more besieged areas.
A new UN task force set up to co-ordinate aid distributions convened in Geneva on Friday.
Some Syrian cities have been cut off from aid for more than a year because of fighting. About 13.5 million people are in need, the UN says.
In his rare interview recorded on Thursday, Mr Assad told AFP news agency that defeating the groups ranged against him could take some time due to the involvement of regional powers.
Mr Assad expressed support for peace talks but said negotiations did not mean "we stop fighting terrorism". And he vowed to sever the rebels' supply route from Turkey.
Syrian government forces, backed by Russian air strikes, have almost encircled rebels in parts of the northern city of Aleppo.

It is the latest in a series of steps by Mr Abadi to ease sectarian tensions and crack down on corruption.
Baghdad has seen weeks of protests over poor services and abuses of power.
Earlier this month, in a rare show of unity, the Iraqi parliament backed Mr Abadi's programme to abolish top government posts and cut spending.
On Friday, the prime minister issued instructions to lift restrictions on the Green Zone. It is not clear when the plan will be implemented.
The compound, in the Karkh district on the west bank of the Tigris, is surrounded by concrete walls and heavily guarded by checkpoints and tanks.
It houses former palaces of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein and was the administrative headquarters of the US occupation authorities. Several foreign embassies, including those of the US and UK, are situated there.
Most Iraqis have been excluded from the Green Zone unless they have special permission, and large bribes have been paid to get round stringent entry procedures, according to AFP news agency.
The zone has been targeted by bombings and rockets over the years, and the fortification measures were aimed at making it more secure, although attacks in Baghdad are still commonplace.
Mr Abadi also ordered the removal of barriers and checkpoints set up on main roads and sidestreets in Baghdad and elsewhere by prominent figures and militias.
The order to lift the restrictions is part of a series of measures to defuse tensions and root out corruption. A panel will also be set up to recover state property appropriated by elites which are found to have been illegally obtained.

City are now 10 points behind leaders Chelsea after defeat on Merseyside - the heaviest league loss in Guardiola's managerial career.
Asked if the gap was too great, he said: "Yes. Ten is a lot of points."
Guardiola, 45, has told his players to unite "in the bad moments" and "forget the table" until the end of the season.
He added: "At the end of the season, we are going to evaluate our level and how our performance was, how the coach was, how the players were. After that we are going to decide."
The former Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss insisted he was "so happy in Manchester" despite his side sitting fifth, two points behind fourth-placed Arsenal.
Guardiola watched City dominate possession on Merseyside but concede four from the six shots they faced.
Only five teams have a lower haul than their four clean sheets in the league - BBC Radio 5 live pundit Robbie Savage said City "cannot defend" and questioned if Guardiola would now change his style.
City are the only team in the Premier League to have over 50% of possession in every game this season but they have now conceded from the first shot they have faced in four of their last seven games.
Guardiola added: "I said to the players be positive because you made some fantastic things during the season and for many reasons we didn't get what I think we deserved.
"In the bad moments we have to be close. It's awful for my players. We created chances but don't score and when they have a chance, they punish us."
Everton scored with their first two shots through Romelu Lukaku and Kevin Mirallas, with Tom Davies and Ademola Lookman completing the rout.
Lookman's goal came after a John Stones clearance was charged down, throwing the young defender again under the spotlight.

===Input Doc/Src: The ruling by a US district judge is the latest twist in a long-running legal battle going back to 2013.
Costco, which is to appeal against the decision, argues that "Tiffany" is now a generic term for the rings.
But it has now been told it must call them "Tiffany-style" instead.
The dispute centres on the sale of solitaire-style rings, comprising a diamond mounted on a single band with six prongs.
Costco, which had sold 2,500 of them, put them on display with the label "Tiffany", although they were not in fact made by the jeweller.
An earlier court ruling in October 2016 ordered Costco to pay $5.5m in compensatory damages and $8.25m in punitive damages.
But in a further court decision on Monday, the compensation was increased to $11.1m, while the amount of punitive damages still stands.
Kate Swaine, a partner at law firm Gowling WLG, said: "This damages award may seem excessive given that only 2,500 products were sold, but if it can be argued that an infringement is blatant and where it relates to such a well-known brand, the claimant is entitled to seek punitive damages.
"Brand owners will welcome this decision as an indication of the risk that third parties run in trying to make associations with famous brands."
The cheapest engagement ring on Tiffany's US website currently costs $12,000 (Â£9,300) while customers can buy one from Costco's website for only $380 (Â£295).

Eleven people were killed in Gaza on Wednesday, the health ministry said.
Unnamed Palestinian officials told news agencies a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel would be announced within hours.
After eight days of exchanges of fire between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon are now in Cairo for talks with the Egyptian president.
There were "many details to work out" before a ceasefire could be reached, Mr Ban warned.
By Kevin ConnollyBBC News, Tel Aviv
In the immediate aftermath of the  bus bombing, there was a palpable sense of shock hanging in the air around the scene.
Israel's largest city has seen nothing like this for six-and-a-half years.
One resident - when told that the news of the explosion broadcast from mosques in Gaza has been greeted with a sound of celebratory gunfire there - said that they need to celebrate this as some kind of victory because they have nothing else to offer but violence.
A police helicopter still circled overhead and there were roadblocks at many main junctions around the scene as police hunted for the bomber or bombers seen running away from the scene.
Paradoxically, the explosion and the waves of Israeli air raids on Gaza this morning do not necessarily mean that the search for a ceasefire is dead.
It may mean that both sides are sending a signal that if a deal is agreed, they will be reaching it from what they regard as a position of strength.
The search for a diplomatic solution reaches a critical phase this afternoon when US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton meets Egyptian President Mohammed Mursi - the only leader with effective lines of communication both to Israel and to Hamas.

Its 2013 accounts showed more was spent on costs than went to charity.
There is no suggestions regulations were broken.
Kiltwalk chairman Michael Ure said it had incurred additional costs because of a "re-structuring".
Mr Ure and the rest of the trustees have now stood down.
The Kiltwalk said a new board would oversee the continued development of the charity.
The group has also attracted support from one of Scotland's richest men, the entrepreneur Sir Tom Hunter, whose foundation has committed long-term funding.
Mr Hunter said: "The Kiltwalk is a fantastic concept for raising much-needed funds for Scotland's children's charities and has our absolute support.
"We intend over the next couple of months to redefine and improve the model, building on the foundations already in place, to maximise returns for charities and turbo-charge Scotland's Kiltwalkers for 2016."
The Kiltwalk was set up in 2011 with the aim of bringing Scotland's leading children's charities together for a series of sponsored walks.
It grew from 800 walkers that year to more than 12,000 across the country in 2014.
However, earlier this year four charities - CLIC Sargent, Cash for Kids, Aberlour and Edinburgh's Sick Kids Friends Foundation - withdrew as official partners.
CLIC Sargent and Aberlour indicated to BBC Scotland that they had concerns over the amount of money reaching them from the Kiltwalk.

"I was sitting with my wee girl about to change her nappy. I just jumped up and went mad," said Russell.
Asked where the nappy ended up, he replied, "I don't know!"
The centre-back said he told his girlfriend, who was also watching the draw being made at Hampden, he was certain that when his own team and Vale's names were pulled out that Celtic's would follow.
However, the 26-year-old plumbing and heating engineer confessed he might struggle to focus on his job in the coming days.
"I think my boss will understand if I try to put my head down a toilet or something," he joked.
"I tried to go the gym. I was sitting on the bike just shaking my head."
Russell and his team-mates are determined to focus on their rearranged home game at K Park against Vale on 20 January, but the prospect of the Scottish champions playing at their tiny Lanarkshire ground inevitably seeps into the conversation.
So, can he imagine Celtic manager Ronny Deila watching him play from the stand?
"I'll put it out my head and make sure we get the win," he replied matter-of-factly.
"But after the game if he wants to talk contracts I'll be free!"

They will be joined by country artists Toby Keith and Bobby Braddock and blues pioneer Willie Dixon.
The ceremony will take place on 18 June in New York.
Songwriters Hall of Fame president Linda Moran said: "Each one of these brilliant music creators have written instantly recognisable classics, songs that are both of their time and timeless."
Cyndi Lauper became a household name by covering Robert Hazard's Girls Just Wanna Have Fun in the 1980s - but she has also had hits of her own and won a Tony Award in 2013 for best score for the hit Broadway musical Kinky Boots.
Linda Perry was a member of 4 Non Blondes and has written hits for stars including Pink, Gwen Stefani and Alicia Keys. One of her biggest successes was Beautiful, which was a worldwide hit for Christina Aguilera.
Toby Keith has sold more than 40 million albums worldwide, while Braddock is a songwriter who has had a career of more than 40 years and is the only living person to have written number one country hits in five consecutive decades.
His songs have become country music standards, including DIVORCE, recorded by Tammy Wynette.
Willie Dixon, who died in 1992, was one of the most prolific songwriters of all time, he has been called "the poet laureate of the blues".
His most famous compositions include Hoochie Coochie Man, I Just Want to Make Love to You and You Can't Judge a Book by the Cover.
Dixon's songs have been recorded by artists including Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin and the Rolling Stones.
The songwriters were chosen from a list that also included Tom Petty, Vince Gill, Elvis Costello and Kenneth Babyface Edmonds.

Swapping a couple of servings a week for other vegetables should counter this, say the authors.
UK dietary advice says starchy foods (carbohydrates) such as potatoes should make up about a third of the food people eat.
There is no official limit on how much carbohydrate people should consume each week.
Foods that contain carbohydrates affect blood sugar.
Some - high Glycaemic Index (GI) foods - release the sugar quickly into the bloodstream.
Others - low GI foods - release them more steadily.
Research suggests eating a low GI diet can help manage diabetes.
Pregnancy puts extra demands on the body, and some women develop diabetes at this time.
Gestational diabetes, as it is called, usually goes away after the birth but can pose long-term health risks for the mother and baby.
The BMJ study set out investigate what might make some women more prone to pregnancy diabetes.
The study followed nurses who became pregnant between 1991 and 2001. None of them had any chronic diseases before pregnancy.
Every four years, the women were asked to provide information on how often potatoes featured in their diets, and any cases of gestational diabetes were noted.
Over the 10-year period, there were 21,693 pregnancies and 854 of these were affected by gestational diabetes.
The study took into account other risk factors, such as:
It found a 27% increased risk of diabetes during pregnancy in the nurses who typically ate two to four 100g (3.5oz) servings of boiled, mashed, baked potatoes or chips a week.
In those who ate more than five portions of potatoes or chips a week, the risk went up by 50%.
The researchers estimate that if wom

===Input Doc/Src: The case - which has seen the faces of the judges involved splashed across newspaper front pages -  began its proceedings through the Supreme Court on Monday.
There, the UK government will appeal against the ruling of the High Court, which said MPs should be able to vote on the starting-whistle to leave the European Union.
They will be joined by a number of other parties which are intervening, including the Scottish and Welsh governments.
In a nutshell, it is over whether ministers can use executive powers to start the process of leaving the EU without consulting MPs.
Ministers hold what are known as royal prerogative powers which allow them to take decisions without Parliament's approval.
The case brought by claimants - the investment manager Gina Miller and hairdresser Dier Dos Santos - was that the government cannot use these powers to override rights enshrined in acts of Parliament.
High Court judges agreed, but the UK government rejects this argument and has appealed to the Supreme Court.
The BBC legal correspondent Clive Coleman explains the case in more detail here.
The Welsh Government has been allowed to intervene in the case, arguing that triggering Article 50 would "significantly change" how devolution works.
Permission to intervene means ministers will have their case heard in front of Supreme Court judges.
Counsel General Mick Antoniw argues that triggering Article 50 changes the powers of the assembly and the Welsh Government, and that this cannot be done without a vote in Parliament.
The Welsh Government claims a large number of its functions come from EU law and will "be lost upon the UK's withdrawal from the EU Treaties".
Separately, the counsel general's case sets out that triggering Article 50 will effectively circumvent the Sewel Convention, a set of rules that mean any attempt to change a law in a devolved area of policy needs the consent of AMs.
Mr Antoniw does not ask state that the assembly has a legally enforceable right to veto any Westmins
---Sum/Tgt: It is difficult to think of a court case in recent years as politically charged and controversial as the legal row over whether MPs should vote to trigger Article 50 - the process to start Brexit.

===Input Doc/Src: Ms Saunders will head the Crown Prosecution Service when Keir Starmer stands down in October.
The career CPS lawyer has overseen some of the country's most important prosecutions and is currently the organisation's London chief.
The DPP is the most senior criminal prosecutor in England and Wales, responsible for more than 6,800 staff.
By Clive ColemanLegal correspondent, BBC News
The role of Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) is critical within the criminal justice system of England and Wales.
The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) is the organisation that can deliver justice by making independent decisions as to whether there is sufficient evidence to charge a suspect, and when it decides that there is, by prosecuting the case effectively.
It works closely with the police but must always be seen to make independent and dispassionate decisions based upon the evidence gathered.
It can only prosecute when it concludes that there is sufficient evidence for there to be a realistic prospect of conviction, and that the prosecution is in the public interest.
The DPP is the hands-on, day-to-day head of the CPS - which is currently negotiating a period of austerity and modernisation. Maintaining public confidence in it will be critical.
The Attorney General, Dominic Grieve, said: "Alison will make an excellent director of public prosecutions and is the right person to help the Crown Prosecution Service meet the challenges it will face in the coming years.
"I am particularly pleased that Alison is the first head of the CPS to be appointed from within its ranks as proof of the high quality of the professionals that work within the service.
"I'd also like to thank Keir Starmer for the great contribution he has made - not only to the CPS but more generally to the criminal justice system.  He can be proud of the reforms that he and his staff have led to keep our criminal justice system one of the best in the world."
Ms Saunders said: "I am delighted and privileged to be appointed

===Input Doc/Src: Arpad Kore and Bartosz Bortniczak, both 18, and Jordanna Goodwin, Megan Storey, and Blake Cairns, all 16, died in the crash in South Yorkshire.
Their car collided head-on with another vehicle on the A630 near Conisbrough on 15 November, 2014.
Doncaster coroner Nicola Mundy ruled that each of the five teenager's deaths was accidental.
The other car driver was injured.
Jonathan Earp was in a car ahead of the Toyota Corolla at the time of the crash.
Giving evidence at the inquest, he said when he got to the vehicle all the teenagers except his friend Arpad Kore were unconscious.
"He was screaming out in pain and begging me not to leave him," Mr Earp told the court.
He said he was unable to open the car doors and held his friend's hand until the emergency services arrived.
Ms Mundy said she agreed with collision investigators that the most likely cause of the accident was that Mr Bortniczak took his foot off the accelerator as he negotiated a right-hand bend, causing a classic case of "lift-off over-steer".
The car, which had been travelling at about 73mph in a 60mph zone, skidded and was side-on when it hit the Seat.
Tests showed the car would have been able to safely take the bend at that speed if the driver had kept his foot on the accelerator.
Recording her conclusion, Ms Mundy said: "It was the most tragic of accidents. Five young people, who had their lives ahead of them, losing their lives in these circumstances.
"I do not think there were any signs of recklessness. It was a mistake and a high price was paid for it."
The crash happened after the five friends met up with two others - Ben York and Jonathan Earp - who were in a Vauxhall Corsa.
The court heard there had been an investigation into whether the cars had been racing after one witness, Michael Staton, said he had seen two unidentified vehicles at traffic lights revving their engines and then "set off like a dragster start".
Mr York, the driver of the Corsa, was arrested on suspicion of causing death by da

===Input Doc/Src: The Glasgow number 10 has played just 12 minutes of the championship, coming off the bench in the defeat by Wales.
But in the absence of the injured Finn Russell, he has been preferred to Peter Horne, who impressed against France.
"It's tough on him not being selected but it's an opportunity for me," said Weir, who wins his 23rd cap in Dublin.
"The coaches have given me confidence this week. They have watched my Glasgow footage and are happy where I am and my development over the last month or so.
"I feel confident in my game at the minute and just need to back it up come Saturday.
"It is a huge honour getting back into the side. I have been here training, so I know the calls and structures, so it is not being thrown in to the deep end as I have been here throughout the championship."
With Russell still going through concussion return-to-play protocols after receiving a head knock five minutes into the France game, Cotter had the option of continuing with Horne - who he called "probably a 12-10 rather than a 10-12" - after he stepped into the fray with aplomb.
"I was just hugely proud of his performance," Weir said of his Glasgow team-mate. "A guy who has not run a rep pretty much the whole tournament at 10 steps up and shows how natural a ball player he is.
"It was great for me to go on and see him run the attack. Being a playmaker at 12, he is always chatting and orchestrating play anyway."
Having played second fiddle to Russell at club level as well as with the national team, being left out of the match-day 23 for the last two Tests against Italy and France has allowed Weir more game time with Glasgow.
He duly delivered two Pro 12 man-of-the-match displays against Newport Gwent Dragons and Cardiff Blues.
"I have been getting a run of games so I feel confident in my form," he added. "Moving onto the ball you have to make better decisions when you have a run of games going. I feel really excited about the opportunity."

===Input Doc/Src: Increasingly services are springing up offering quick fixes for the annoyance of cracked screens or broken home buttons.
New entrant, iCracked, is hoping its model of sending technicians to customers, sometimes within an hour, will help it win market share.
But critics questioned what impact it would have.
The firm already operates in 250 US cities and as the name suggests, focuses mainly on iOS devices but also repairs some Samsung models.
The prices it will charge for fixing devices will vary but will average about £57, according to the firm.
"For most people, their phone is an extension of themselves, so when it breaks it can have a huge impact on the way they go about their everyday lives," said founder A J Forsythe.
The firm began life in 2010 at a US university where Mr Forsythe was a student.
"I started handing out flyers around campus and people would call me and I'd fix their device," he told the BBC.
Growth came fast and the firm now employs 1,000 technicians across the US.
Its UK launch will initially be focused in London with 30 technicians which it hopes to expand to 100 next year.
Customers can call out a fixer either via the iCracked website or its app. They then arrange a time for them to come to their home, office or local coffee shop to repair the device.
There is a burgeoning industry springing up around smartphone repairs. High street shops offer drop-in services where they can repair phones or tablets in a matter of hours, often more cheaply than iCracked.
Websites such as Quick Fix Mobile also offer repairs within 24 hours, with prices averaging £30 - £50 for a broken screen.
Marketing manager Sean Barber was dismissive of iCracked.
"I'm not sure why these big companies come from the US and make such big news. There are already plenty of others in the UK already offering this service."
He compared iCracked's launch with that of Uber, the lift-sharing service which has proved controversial to the taxi industry.

===Input Doc/Src: Thomas Gallagher, 16, was discovered by a member of the public in Old Kays Park in Tottington, Bury, in July 2015.
An inquest concluded the schoolboy took his own life and police shortcomings did not contribute to his death.
But an Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) report found Greater Manchester Police's (GMP) conduct was "below the standard expected."
The teenager's parents criticised police, saying there had been serious failings in the handling of the case, the Manchester Evening News reports.
In a statement they said: "We explained his vulnerabilities concerning his recent mental health history. Subsequently two members of the public found Tom five hours later. GMP failed to respond at all."
The IPCC found police delayed looking for the schoolboy because of staffing shortages in the Bury division, which were "foreseeable".
"No officers were deployed...until the discovery of Thomas' body some five hours later," the investigator found.
The report said the response of four officers and a radio operator was "unsatisfactory".
It said the conduct of an inspector, a police sergeant, an acting police sergeant, a police constable and a civilian radio operator, "whilst not amounting to misconduct, did fall below the standard expected."
IPCC Associate Commissioner, Guido Liguori, recommended GMP "should address" the "under-resourcing" of the police division in Bury as well as "ensuring police officers and staff are properly supported" for "the benefit of the local community."
Ch Supt Chris Sykes from GMP's Bury division said: "Thomas Gallagher's death was a tragedy and our deepest condolences remain with his family.
"Unfortunately, it was not possible for GMP to resource the original missing report, due to staff abstractions and a higher than usual number of incidents on the night."
Changes have already been implemented in Bury, including new shift patterns, to ensure the force could respond to unanticipated spikes in demand in future, he added.

===Input Doc/Src: Bees debutant Marco Djuricin had given his side the lead when he found the net with a curling strike.
And the Austria international almost doubled his tally after the break when his first-time shot clipped the post.
But, after Chris Wood saw his attempt turned onto the woodwork at the other end, substitute Antenucci dispossessed Ryan Woods before firing in to level.
Leeds have now scored just twice against Brentford in five matches, having failed to win any of the games dating back to the 2009-10 season.
Media playback is not supported on this device
The visitors took the lead when Djuricin, who joined on loan from Red Bull Salzburg on 31 August, found the net midway through the first half.
Jake Bidwell then went close to doubling the lead when his second-half header bounced across goal, before another Djuricic attempt hit the post.
Leeds striker Wood also saw a deflected effort hit the woodwork, when his shot was turned onto the post by Bees goalkeeper David Button.
But, just when it looked like it might turn out to be a first defeat of the season for the hosts, Brentford's debutant substitute Woods - who had only been on the pitch for two minutes - was easily dispossessed by Antenucci and the Italian, who had come on at half-time, fired home the equaliser into the corner with his left foot.
The result means Leeds remain unbeaten this season, having drawn five of their six opening games in the Championship.
Leeds manager Uwe Rosler:
"We lost our fearlessness and we made a mistake. When you do that against Brentford they can find the holes.
"Then we were down on confidence and they scored. We looked like we were afraid to get on the ball, that can happen. We deserved to trail at half-time.
"In the second half we started 0-0 and the substitutes helped us. The last 25-30 minutes we battered them in a football sense and could have won the game. I think it was a fair result for two teams who wanted to win."

===Input Doc/Src: Alpha Foxtrot, affectionately known as Foxy, was the last of the fleet to fly when the jet was withdrawn from service in 2003, and displaying it at the airfield was only ever a temporary solution.
Concorde enthusiasts are keen to see the aircraft indoors, protected from the elements, and back on display as soon as possible.
But the decision rests with Airbus and British Airways (BA) who are currently considering two separate business plans for museums to house the jet.
So how vital is it to get a roof over the plane?
Ben Lord, chairman of the Save Concorde Group, which submitted its plan for a museum in June 2011, said he was expecting a decision "any day".
The group would like to see Foxy fly again in the future, but Mr Lord said this could only happen if the aircraft was looked after indoors.
"Obviously the long-term thinking is if it's indoors, nice and dry, where engineers can get easier access, ultimately that enhances the prospect of it flying again," he said.
"But the aircraft is still exposed to the elements. Largely it's causing corrosion issues. People could argue that it was outside all the time when it was in service, but when it's flying the outside skin heats up to 127C so it was keeping it dry.
"Being exposed to harsh winters and rainy conditions isn't good for it.
"The shameful part of it all is it will be nine years in November. By now it should be under cover."
The Concorde Trust has been working on plans for an indoor museum for some years, but hit a snag in May last year when their bid for £2.9m from the Heritage lottery Fund was turned down.
The trust has since submitted revised plans.
Project director Lloyd Burnell said the trust was working with the Bristol Aero Collection (BAC) on plans for a museum.
"It needs to be undercover for the preservation of the aircraft. Aircraft are not designed to sit around," he said.
Another reason they want it indoors is so the museum can also display the BAC - exhibits charting 100 years of the city's aviation

===Input Doc/Src: It was widely anticipated the Spending Review would confirm the need for police efficiencies would remain at the top of the agenda, at least until 2020.
The Home Office is not one of the favoured "protected" ministries shielded from cuts.
And as 71% of its gross spending goes on crime and policing, that is where most of the department's cuts have bitten.
Add to that Home Secretary Theresa May's determination to reform policing, and there was a strong sense the government would not change course.
That was certainly the expectation at Manchester Town Hall, where chief constables and police and crime commissioners (PCCs) had gathered for their annual joint conference.
At 12:30, a large group of them took their places around a television set in a room set aside for exhibitors to watch the chancellor's statement. The mood was sombre. Most chiefs and PCCs had been planning for cuts of 20-25%.
The Inspectorate of Constabulary had suggested that by 2018, forces would have to shed at least 12,000 officer, staff and police community support officer (PCSO) posts, with further reductions after that.
The inspectorate, known for its careful, measured commentary, warned some forces might not be able to withstand another round of cuts, because they were not efficient enough. It said the "operational viability" of some could be "in jeopardy".
The National Police Chiefs Council, which co-ordinates the work of forces, feared the job losses would be even worse - 35,000 by 2020, which, Sara Thornton, who chairs the council, said in July, would be a "game changer".
Constabularies with large urban areas stood to lose the most, as they tend to rely more on Home Office funding, among them Northumbria, which gets 85% of its income from central government, and the West Midlands, 83%.
So, when the announcement came, towards the end of Mr Osborne's statement, that there would be no further policing cuts, there was genuine disbelief, mixed with delight.

One new development in Radstock Street in Battersea will see eight large apartments go on the market in February for £3.65m each.
For most people around the UK, that is an eye-watering price for a three-bedroom property. Yet, the developers say these homes will be attractive to downsizers - people aged in their 50s and 60s already owning a home in central London.
The idea of downsizing to a £3m-plus home might make those eyes water a little more, but Louisa Brodie, head of search at Banda Property, says these apartments are "realistically priced".
"They have car parking, a porter, and are brand new. Properties like this are rare to find, and areas like this have a unique selling point," she says. "London is still one of the most desirable places to live, anywhere."
This is surely a sign that London property has been decoupled from the rest of the country for many years.
Despite the drop in activity in London, the average house price in the capital is still £474,000, more than double the typical price of £217,000 in the UK as a whole, according to the latest official figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
The slowdown in central London is the result of the most significant change in the housing market in 2016 - a stamp duty surcharge on buy-to-let and second homes.
Since April, anyone buying a home that is not their main residence has had to pay a 3% stamp duty surcharge. This meant that, for second homes or buy-to-let properties, the rate for properties priced at more than

===Input Doc/Src: In a thinly veiled attack on president Sepp Blatter's leadership, Michael Garcia reiterated the need for "greater transparency".
"The investigation and adjudication process operates in most parts unseen and unheard," continued Garcia.
He added that the organisation needs a "leadership that sends a message that the rules apply to everyone".
Talking about the current investigation process, Garcia said: "That's a kind of system which might be appropriate for an intelligence agency but not for an ethics compliance process in an international sports institution that serves the public and is the subject of intense public scrutiny."
American lawyer Garcia concluded his lengthy investigation into the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bidding process last month and handed his report to Fifa's ethics adjudicator Hans Joachim Eckert, but he is disappointed by the world governing body's insistence on keeping his report confidential.
In a keynote speech at an event organised by the American Bar Association in London, Garcia added: "The natural next step of the development of an effective ethics process at Fifa is greater transparency.
"The second element that is vital to fulfilling the promise of this reform process is tone at the top.
"More simply put, the second element an institution like Fifa needs in order to meet the challenge of ethics enforcement is leadership. An ethics committee - even a serious, independent ethics committee backed by a strong code of ethics - is not a silver bullet.
"What is required is leadership that sends a message that the rules apply to everyone; leadership that wants to understand and learn from any mistakes or mis-steps the ethics committee may have identified; leadership that makes it clear to everyone - this is what we've set up the ethics committee to do, this is why they do it, and this is what they've done.

===Input Doc/Src: Researchers at St Andrews University said a method using a small circular hole could have wide implications for 3D technology.
The study, published in Psychological Science, also has implications for people who have just one eye or difficulties with double-eye vision.
The method was said to create 3D similar to effects used in film-making.
Researchers said that current thinking was based on the need for two visual images - one from each eye - to be combined in the visual cortex, creating a sense of depth.
But Dr Dhanraj Vishwanath, a psychologist at the university, believes both eyes are not necessary for this "3D experience".
Dr Vishwanath said: "We have demonstrated experimentally, for the first time, that the same 'special way' in which depth is experienced in 3D movies can also be experienced by looking at a normal picture with one eye viewing through a small aperture (circular hole).
"While this effect has been known for a long time, it is usually dismissed.
"Now we have shown that it is in fact real, and the perceptual results are exactly like stereoscopic 3D, the kind seen in 3D movies.
"Based on this finding, we have provided a new hypothesis of what the actual cause of the 3D experience might be."
The university said the 1838 invention of the stereoscope - the technology behind 3D film-making - brought with it the assumption two eyes were necessary for 3D vision.
Dr Vishwanath said: "This work has significant implications for people who don't have normal binocular vision.
"First it could help them experience what it means to see in 3D. Second, it could encourage them to seek therapy to try to regain two-eye 3D vision (which produces the strongest 3D effect in everyday life) once they can see first-hand what 'seeing in 3D' is really like."
Dr Vishwanath and his colleagues are now testing the method with a large group of strabismics, people with misaligned eyes.
He said that nearly 15% of the population, including Hollywood actor Johnny Depp, may have some fo

===Input Doc/Src: It was the night he called time on his political career.
He was surrounded by family and friends outside his home in the area of Londonderry where he had spent most of his life - three streets away from where he was born.
He never travelled far from his roots but his political journey took him far beyond the comfort of the Bogside.
From directing IRA gunmen in Derry, to wearing tails in Windsor Castle at a banquet for the Queen.
From standing in Derry on Bloody Sunday when soldiers shot dead 13 people, to bowing his head at the Somme war graves.
Along the way he struck up the most unlikely friendship with the man who once branded him a "bloodthirsty monster" - Ian Paisley.
Away from the glare of the press he also struck up friendships with relatives who lost loved ones at the hands of the IRA.
But no matter how far he reached out, for some he will always be an IRA commander who brought his dark secrets to the grave
For many unionists Martin McGuinness's fingerprints are all over the Troubles - a man who did not become an IRA leader without getting his hands dirty.
For republicans, his fingerprints are all over the peace process and Sinn FÃ©in's steady rise in the polls, which brought them to within 1,000 votes of being the largest party at Stormont.
But Sinn FÃ©in's one-time chief negotiator always found his toughest negotiation was with his own people.
And especially in his home city where he faced threats from dissident republicans and his family were verbally abused on the street because of the decisions he made.
He did not have to travel far from his front door to see it.
On a wall at the bottom of his street, dissident republicans regularly daub graffiti attacking their former comrades who now sit at Stormont.

===Input Doc/Src: His firm, Cameron Pace Group and its Chinese partners will develop advanced equipment for 3D filming.
The move comes amid a boom in China's movie industry and a growing demand for 3D films in the country.
Various Hollywood filmmakers have been trying to tap into the Chinese market.
"The future of entertainment is 3D and we believe that the future of 3D is right here in China," Mr Cameron was quoted as saying by the Associated Press news agency.
Earlier this year, Chinese authorities had announced that they will allow an additional 14 foreign films to be shown in the country, if the movies are made in 3D or for the big-screen Imax format.
China's movie industry has seen robust growth in the past few years.
Ticket sales in the world's second-largest economy surged 29% to 13.1bn yuan ($2.1bn; Â£1.3bn) in 2011. They are forecast to rise further, by around 20% in the current year.
The growth in its market has seen various Hollywood filmmakers and studios announcing joint ventures with Chinese firms.
Earlier this week, Dreamworks Animation announced plans to co-produce the next Kung Fu Panda movie with its Chinese partners. The firm said it was also planning to open an entertainment district in the country.
In April, Walt Disney Company, the world's largest entertainment firm, said that it plans to co-produce Iron Man 3 with Beijing-based DMG Entertainment.
Mr Cameron said that the robust growth in the country's market made it attractive destination.
"This is the best place for us to create a kind of a second home," he said.

===Input Doc/Src: A win over Motherwell was not enough and Foran, who wants to stay on as manager, felt let down by some players.
The manager made reference to "two or three bad apples in the dressing room".
And he added: "I probably should have got rid of them in January. I stayed loyal to a lot of players and some of them didn't pay me back."
Inverness won three of their last four Premiership matches as they fought to finish in the play-off spot.
But Hamilton Accies' 4-0 hammering of Dundee on Saturday ensured they will face Dundee United for a spot in the Premiership next term, while Inverness will play Championship football despite their 3-2 win over Well.
"It's obviously disappointment," Foran added. "The best clubs in the world get knocked down, it's how you rebuild and come back. I've told the players there are far worse off people in life.
"But it happens in football. It is not all rosy. It is not all about winning all the time. I've been part of relegation teams - you stay loyal, you rebuild. You get knocked down, you get back up again.
"You need to get rid of the two or three players you don't want, that haven't given 100%, and I look forward to getting rid of those three.
"Of the starting 11 today, I would hope to have at least 10 of those for next season [midfielder Greg Tansey is leaving to join Aberdeen]. I am very proud of the players and when we got the right team playing, we could finish well, with guys giving their all for the club."
Foran, who was a player at the time, stayed with Inverness when they were relegated from the top flight in 2009.
One year into a four-year contract, he hopes to do the same as manager.
"I want to be here next season," he said. "I will have a chat with the board probably on Monday or Tuesday and will find out what their thoughts are. But I am 100% behind this club and I expect to be here next season.

===Input Doc/Src: The club are close to appointing the former Ajax and Inter Milan boss, 47, to succeed Sam Allardyce, who led Palace to 14th in the Premier League in May following a relegation battle.
"The Champions League is not realistic but with good organisation you can stay in the middle," De Boer said.
"With a great season, maybe you could sneak European football."
Between 2010 and 2016, De Boer coached Ajax, winning the Eredivisie for four consecutive seasons between 2011 and 2015.
But the former Netherlands international has been out of work since he was sacked by Inter Milan in November 2016 after only 85 days in charge.
"It's always been one of his desires to come to the Premier League," added Ronald.
"It's the biggest league in the world - not necessarily the best - but the most exciting for sure. Frank wants to be part of that and hopefully he gets that opportunity with Crystal Palace.
"As it stands now, I know that both sides want to go with each other but there are just little things to discuss."
De Boer was appointed as Inter boss two weeks before the start of the 2015-16 season after Roberto Mancini left by mutual consent.
He had never previously coached or played in Italy and led Inter to just four league wins in his opening 11 games, leaving them 12th in the Serie A table.
"Falling down on your face sometimes helps you to move forward," said his brother.
"It's so difficult to step into a team who are not at all fit and have an average age of 28, just two weeks before the start of the season. It is very difficult to change the philosophy.
"But he learned he needs a good pre-season to get a proper idea of what his squad is about.
"He is more than capable of doing well with any team and also with Crystal Palace if he decides to sign with them."
---Sum/Tgt: Frank de Boer could help Crystal Palace to the Europa League if he takes charge at Selhurst Park, says brother Ronald.

===Input Doc/Src: Ann Barnes dealt with an "ill-advised" TV documentary, a probe into her car insurance, and youth commissioners who both had to step away from their role.
But she said she judged her time as PCC as a success.
She said Kent Police was now target-free, provided quality service and put victims at the heart of its work.
"Apart from one or two things I'd rather not have happened, I've really, really had a good time," she said.
Referring to incidents that led to adverse headlines, she said: "You have to accept what life throws at you and deal with it."
Mrs Barnes, who is not standing for re-election, said the Kent force was recognised nationally after latest HMIC reports.
"[Kent Police] genuinely puts victims at the heart of what it does. There are no targets, people don't chase targets. They just look to do a quality service," she said.
On her youth commissioner appointments, Mrs Barnes said: "You can't interview for the unexpected."
Kent's first youth commissioner Paris Brown resigned over comments she had posted on Twitter, and Kerry Boyd had to stop public engagements while reports of a relationship were investigated.
Mrs Barnes said Ms Brown handled things well after making mistakes when younger, and Ms Boyd did a good job and could have continued but turned down an extended contract.
After Ms Boyd left, the youth commissioner was not replaced.
Mrs Barnes said she was most proud of Kent Police's "open and transparent" culture.
And she said a new victim centre was providing "a wraparound service" to victims and witnesses, and she believed it would become a blueprint for delivering victims' services.

===Input Doc/Src: Thousands upon thousands of local council jobs look like getting the axe due to the spending squeeze, yet 270 jobs rolling steel slabs get a task force, all hands are on deck to find a buyer, while the opposition calls for nationalisation.
It's not hard to see why. Nostalgia is part of it, these being the remnants of a once great and noble industry, around which large parts of Lanarkshire was built.
It's partly because Clydebridge and Dalzell are symbolic of the impact of globalisation, forcing transition on workers and communities at a local level as the price of enriching the broader economy.
Other parts of Britain and Europe feel the strain of in-migrating people. In Motherwell and Cambuslang, the concern is about out-migrating jobs.
But it's also because there's discomfort that the new economy and the new labour market is unplanned and haphazard, buffeted by market forces and lacking in the security of big plants with jobs-for-life.
It is not always easy to appreciate that Britain has grown quite successfully in recent years by retreating from the making of things.
The service sector makes up 75% of the economy, and while it ranges from high-value finance and professional roles to burger-flipping and care homes, it lacks that noble quality with which the old heavy (and dirty) industries are seen in hindsight.
There is widespread agreement that Britain needs to think again about manufacturing. On the freer market end of things, George Osborne coined the evocative ambition for there to be a "march of the makers".
The rhetoric hasn't always matched the policy outcomes. Industrial policy at Westminster now consists of a push towards a more technically literate workforce, and incentives aimed at 11 chosen sectors, ranging across aerospace and automotive to nuclear and wind power, life sciences and professional and business services.
There are also 'catapult centres' for propelling ideas towards the market in robotics, synthetic biology and better batteries.

With 246 delegates at stake, the southern state is the biggest prize.
Mr Sanders had a surprise victory in Michigan on Tuesday, but Hillary Clinton increased her overall lead with a big win in Mississippi.
In the Republican race on the same day, Donald Trump won three more states (Michigan, Mississippi and Hawaii) in his bid to win the Republican nomination. Ted Cruz won a Republican-only race in Idaho.
The states were the latest to choose candidates to compete in November's presidential election.

During the Miami debate, former Secretary of State Mrs Clinton criticised Vermont Senator Mr Sanders for voting against an immigration reform back in 2007.
"Just think, imagine where we would be today if we had achieved comprehensive immigration reform nine years ago," she said.
Mr Sanders responded by saying he had concerns about the treatment of guest workers. The proposed programme was "akin to slavery", he said.
He also said that Mrs Clinton was against allowing illegal immigrants to obtain driver's licences.
It's been only three days since their last debate, but all it took for the political fortunes in the Democratic presidential race to change dramatically was one day of voting in Michigan.
Thanks to Bernie Sanders' shocking - albeit narrow - upset win in that state's primary on Tuesday, Hillary Clinton went from exuding confidence on Sunday night in Flint to acknowledging on Wednesday evening in Miami that she's "not a natural politician".

And they are all asking each other the same question: "What time is it?"
The clocks on our phones have reset themselves to French time, and for the surprising number who are not wearing watches, the confusion is palpable.
Then the phones start beeping. "Welcome to France!" read the incoming text messages. "Your roaming costs are..."
Inadvertent roaming, as it is called, is surprisingly common in this part of the country, despite France itself being a fair distance away - there are 74 miles (119km) between Poole and Cherbourg, a popular ferry route.
Visitors to the surrounding areas, including Portland near Weymouth, can find themselves suddenly connected to French networks, and, if they're not careful, run up their phone bills with every phone call, text and social network update being charged as if it was made from abroad.
It's not only a problem along the south coast of England - residents and visitors along the borders of Northern Ireland face substantial issues with their phones connecting to Irish networks, often without them even realising it.
In 2012 research carried out there by industry regulator Ofcom found that on average those affected were spending Â£300 a year each on accidental data roaming, and only 11% of them had thought to switch the service off on the phone itself.
The worst affected areas were east and north County Londonderry - notably Portstewart, south County Armagh and south County Down.
"The EU Roaming Regulation requires that mobile operators take reasonable steps to protect their customers from paying roaming charges for inadvertently accessed roaming services while situated in their home member state, and to make information available to their customers on how to avoid inadvertent roaming in border regions," said an Ofcom representative.

===Input Doc/Src: The Scottish writer posted a message on his official website saying his next novel The Quarry, due to be published later this year, would be his last.
The 59-year-old's novels include The Wasp Factory, The Crow Road, Complicity and the Culture series.
The statement said his health problems came to light when he saw his doctor, suffering from a sore back.
He was diagnosed with jaundice, before further tests established the full extent of his illness.
In the personal statement on his website, Banks said he had asked his partner Adele to marry him and was now on a short honeymoon.
Banks' first novel The Wasp Factory was published in 1984 and introduced the Fife-born writer as  a dark new force in British literature.
Described in turn as "macabre... bizarre... and depraved," the book was included in a 1997 poll of the 20th Century's top 100 books, placed higher than Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men.
Subsequent novels, including Espedair Street and The Crow Road, were adapted for radio and television and his 1993 book Complicity was made into a film in 2000, starring Trainspotting's Jonny Lee Miller.
Considered one of Scotland's foremost writers, most of whose books are set in his home country, the writer ventures further afield in his parallel career as a writer of science fiction under the guise of Iain M Banks.
Using his middle name of Menzies - on the advice of his publisher who said it looked "more American" for a US market - several of Banks' sci-fi works are set in the Culture universe, a semi-anarchist utopia.
His most recent work in the so-called Culture series - The Hydrogen Sonata - was released last year. In its review - the Independent praised Banks' "taste for the absurd".
Fellow Scottish author, Ian Rankin, said the news of Banks' terminal cancer was "just awful".

===Input Doc/Src: Comic Enterprises successfully argued in the High Court that 20th Century Fox's show breached its trademark right to The Glee Club name.
The show's broadcaster appealed against the 2014 ruling, but appeal court judges dismissed their case.
It is not yet clear whether the Glee show's name will have to be changed.
The appeal court judges are now due to consider whether EU trademark law affects the ruling and therefore means no change is required.
More updates on this and Birmingham and the Black Country
Part of the film studio's argument was that it should not need to change the name, citing EU law which states a trademark must be "a sign", in the sense of being a single sign and capable of being "graphically represented".  The show's name, it said, did not fall into this category.
As a result, the judges have asked the two parties and the UK Intellectual Property Office to enter their submissions on the issue by Monday when they will consider whether to send the case to the European courts.
The television show first aired in 2009 on the Fox Channel - part of Rupert Murdoch's media empire.
Mark Tughan, owner of the comedy club chain, said he received an 80-page ruling from Lord Justice Lloyd Jones, Lady Justice Arden and Lord Justice Kitchin on Monday following the appeal hearing in November.
Mr Tughan said the comedy club's trademark was registered in 1999 and that he started legal proceedings in 2011.
The film studio is yet to comment on the appeal being thrown out.
Mr Tughan, who tweeted his victory, told BBC News "I feel vindicated, not only for taking the case in the first place but now that two courts have come to the same conclusion about the infringement on my trademark.
"One would hope that Fox would put down their weapons but they have shown no inkling of wanting to settle this."
He added he was awarded some compensation from the High Court hearing but said he is yet to pursue what he feels he is entitled to.

===Input Doc/Src: Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez slotted in the winning spot-kick after Argentina's Gonzalo Higuain fired over and Ever Banega was denied by Claudio Bravo.
Higuain had earlier missed from close range after 90 minutes of few chances.
Sanchez came closest in extra time for Chile, who scored all four of their penalties in the shootout.
Where Chile held their nerve, Argentina wilted in the shootout at the end of a performance that fell well short of the heights they reached in their 6-1 semi-final win over Paraguay.
Le Albiceleste are without a major trophy in the last 22 years since winning the 1993 Copa America in Ecuador.
Chile's victory brought an end to almost a century of competing in the Copa America without claiming a title.
They were one of four teams who played in the very first tournament in 1916 in Argentina but the best they had done until this year was runner-up, which they have achieved on four occasions (1955, 1956, 1979 and 1987).
The Estadio Nacional Julio Martinez Pradanos was a cauldron of noise on Saturday, full of flag-waving red-clad home supporters, some of whom had reportedly paid up to $25,000 for tickets.
They were not treated to a dazzling attacking display from their side but rather one of drive, discipline and, ultimately, composure, epitomised by the industrious and energetic Sanchez and Charles Aranguiz.
Both sides scored their opening penalty, with Matias Fernandez emphatically finding the top corner for Chile before Lionel Messi sent his kick low into the bottom corner.
However, after Arturo Vidal had powerfully dispatched Chile's second, Higuain blazed his effort way over the bar.
Charles Aranguiz made it 3-1 to the hosts and it remained that way as Ever Banega's tame effort was palmed away by the diving Claudio Bravo.
Sanchez showed supreme composure to chip his effort down the middle and in to win the game and the competition for his side.

===Input Doc/Src: Colin Campbell, 56, has primary progressive MS and told BBC Scotland last month that his health had rapidly deteriorated over the last two years.
He has now said he may not attend the Swiss clinic after another MS patient encouraged him to press for more help.
NHS Highland said support was tailored to individual patients' needs.
Assisted suicide is unlawful in Scotland. A move to change the law was defeated in a vote in the Scottish Parliament in 2015.
Mr Campbell, who is booked to go to a clinic in Basel next month, was first diagnosed with MS when he was 34, but had previously suspected he had a health condition because of a deterioration in his ability to play sports.
He told the BBC: "How people should be looking at this is 'Colin is worn out with having had this incredible progressive illness'.
"'His death will give him release.'"
Mr Campbell uses a walking frame to move around his flat and a wheelchair when travelling outside his home.
He formerly worked in IT, still has use of his hands and plays the guitar.
However, he fears he will reach a point where he can no longer use his hands and will be unable to feed himself.
Since expressing his intention to end his life, Mr Campbell has been contacted by fellow MS patient Rona Tynan.

===Input Doc/Src: The bag rocks alarmingly from side-to-side and threatens to overturn.
Now, scientists have investigated this conundrum of everyday physics. Speeding up rather than slowing down can solve the problem, they say.
Alternatively, you can pivot the handle of the suitcase as close to the ground as possible.
French scientists studied a model suitcase on a treadmill to see what goes wrong when a suitcase rocks out of control at high speed.  They developed equations to explain why two-wheeled trolleys have a tendency to rock from one wheel to the other.
In cases of unstable bags - after having gone over a bump, for example - they found luggage rocks from side-to-side until it falls over, or it reaches a regular side-to-side swing.
If a regular side-to-side swing develops, going faster results in smaller swings, said the researchers.
"Thus, one should accelerate rather than decelerate to attenuate the amplitude of oscillations," they explained.
"A non-experienced suitcase puller would not react this way. The outcome should not be a dramatic for a suitcase, but it could be troublesome for a trailer towed by a vehicle."
This leads on to important practical implications of the research, which is published in the journal HRoyal Society Proceedings A.
"The suitcase is a fun way to tackle the problem but the study would be the same for any trolley with two wheels or blades," Sylvain Courrech du Pont, of Universite Paris-Diderot, who led the study, told BBC News.
"So it will be the same for a caravan or maybe also for airplanes."
In technical terms, the mechanical instability is mainly due to the fact that there is a coupling between the translational motion and the rotational motion of the suitcase.
It comes about because the two wheels are fixed together on a rod.
In April, scientists solved another problem of everyday physics - why shoe laces come undone.
They found the force of a foot striking the ground stretches and then relaxes the knot, while a second force caused by the leg

===Input Doc/Src: The Taliban attacked from the mountains as the convoy was travelling through Laghman valley, officials say, and at least 22 insurgents were also killed.
The Sar-e-Pol provincial governor said that a number of security force vehicles were destroyed.
Earlier a civilian was killed in a suicide bomb attack in Kabul.
Villagers also accused Nato of killing seven civilians, including a nine-year-old child, in an air strike in eastern Paktia province.
They were the first people reported killed in air strikes since the new government was installed at the end of September.
However, Nato said Sunday's strike had killed "eight armed enemy combatants".
The issue of Nato air strikes was the most contentious of the many disputes that former President Hamid Karzai had with the international community, reports the BBC's David Loyn in Kabul.
The violence comes ahead of the withdrawal of most foreign troops from Afghanistan by the end of the year, with Afghan security forces increasingly taking over from Nato-led forces in the fight against the militants.
Officials say that at least seven security force members were wounded in the Sar-e-Pol ambush.
Correspondents say that the early morning attack highlights Afghanistan's fragile security structure as Nato withdraws all of its combat troops.
The ambush took place as security forces were travelling to reinforce colleagues in another district of Sar-e-Pol, officials say.
"They called for foreign forces' air support, but they arrived very late," provincial governor Abdul Jabar Haqbin told the AFP news agency.
He said the attack triggered a gun battle that lasted several hours.

===Input Doc/Src: McLaren executive director Zak Brown said he regarded the 17-year-old Englishman as "a fabulous prospect".
Norris won two Formula Renault 2.0 titles last season and will move to the European Formula Three series in 2017.
Triple world champion Lewis Hamilton and Red Bull's Max Verstappen have previously raced in that category.
Norris said he was "immensely excited" about joining McLaren, whose F1 race drivers this year are double world champion Fernando Alonso and novice Stoffel Vandoorne.
"It's hopefully taking me another step closer to reaching my goal of competing in Formula 1," he said.
"I'm honoured to become part of such a prestigious F1 team and to be brought in alongside some very good drivers and experienced people."
Norris will be mentored by McLaren development driver Oliver Turvey, who McLaren describe as the "linchpin" of their F1 simulator programme.
McLaren have also retained Japanese Nobuharu Matsushita, a protege of engine partner Honda, will race again in GP2 and be McLaren's F1 test and development driver.

===Input Doc/Src: Kristin Forbes, a US academic, was the only member of the Monetary Policy Committee to vote to raise rates this month.
This was the first split between policymakers on rates since last July.
"Monetary policy should not go on hold," Ms Forbes wrote in an opinion piece in the Daily Telegraph.
Ms Forbes, who is due to leave the Bank in June, said raising rates would lessen the risk of above-target inflation, and boost an improved outlook for unemployment and UK output.
Official data on Wednesday showed UK pay growth, adjusted for inflation, halved to just 0.7% - the lowest since October 2014.
But Ms Forbes said that recent weakness in wages growth probably reflects temporary caution about Brexit among employers.
The majority of MPC members saw signs of slowing consumer spending as one reason for caution on interest rates, but Ms Forbes said this should be seen in the context of strong levels of consumption in recent months.
"This softening ... should only be moderate, due to support from resilient consumer confidence, solid house prices, low unemployment, and easy access to cheap credit," she said.
"There are risks consumers could pull back more sharply - but these are still just risks."
Although the UK economy faces a long list of risks including slowing growth, she said these "will continue for years" and should not deter policymakers from making "nimble" decisions.
---Sum/Tgt: UK interest rates should be raised, despite risks in the economy, according to a member of the Bank of England's rate-setting committee.

===Input Doc/Src: Wigan had an early double chance, with Will Grigg hitting the post from a corner before Darren Bent cleared off the line from Jake Buxton's follow-up.
Rams keeper Scott Carson denied Grigg when he was put through, while Derby rarely troubled Wigan before the break.
Jussi Jaaskelainen kept out Tom Ince's free-kick to ensure a point for Wigan.
The draw extends Derby's unbeaten run to 10 matches, but leaves them seventh in the table and a point adrift of the play-off places, while Wigan are six points clear of Rotherham at the bottom.
Second-from-bottom Wigan, a side beaten just once in the league in seven previous trips to Derby, dating back to 1984, started strongly against Steve McClaren's Rams, with Michael Jacobs testing Carson soon after Grigg and Buxton went close.
Grigg remained the focal point of the Latics' attack, with Yanic Wildschut's cross for the striker forcing Derby's defence to scramble before the Northern Ireland international had the best chance of the match, bursting clear on the counter only to be foiled by Carson.
Before Ince tested Jaaskelainen with a free-kick after 65 minutes, Derby's brightest moment came courtesy of Ikechi Anya in the first-half, with the winger's run teeing up Johnny Russell for a shot that blazed over the bar.
Derby County manager Steve McLaren: "Scott Carson made some great saves to keep us in the game.
"I was pleased to go in 0-0 at half-time but we addressed that and didn't have any problems in the second half, apart from breaking them down and getting the all-important goal.
"We haven't scored enough goals and we are going to get more games like this where we need to break teams down, so we need individuals and that little bit of magic.
"We need more match winners and I believe we have them but the halfway report is are we scoring enough goals? No, we're not."

===Input Doc/Src: The Rwanda Utilities Regulatory Agency (Rura) said it had received complaints from the public of incitement, hatred, revisionism and genocide denial.
At least 800,000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus died in the genocide.
The BBC has denied that any part of the programme constitutes a "denial of the genocide against the Tutsi".
On Wednesday, Rwandan MPs approved a resolution calling on the government to ban the BBC and to charge the documentary-makers with genocide denial, which is a crime in the country.
Those killed in the genocide are generally believed to be mostly members of the minority ethnic Tutsi group, and Hutus opposed to the mass slaughter.
The BBC programme Rwanda, The Untold Story, includes interviews with US-based researchers who say most of those killed may have been Hutus, killed by members of the then-rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), which has been in power since 1994.
The programme also included interviews with former aides of RPF leader President Paul Kagame, accusing him of plotting to shoot down the presidential plane - the act seen as triggering the slaughter.
He has consistently denied previous such accusations.
Rura said it had established a commission of inquiry to investigate the allegations it had received about the programme, after which further action may be taken.
The cabinet is meeting next week to discuss parliament's recommendations.
The BBC broadcasts affected by the suspension are produced by the BBC Great Lakes service, which was initially set up in the aftermath of the genocide as a lifeline service.
Its first broadcast - BBC Gahuzamiryango, meaning "the unifier of families" - was a 15-minute transmission aimed at bringing together families who had been separated.
---Sum/Tgt: Rwanda has suspended BBC broadcasts in the Kinyarwanda language with immediate effect because of a film questioning official accounts of the 1994 genocide.

===Input Doc/Src: The retired American, 36, said he felt "exploited" by McGregor's camp.
Malignaggi also reacted angrily on social media to an image that showed him down on the canvas during one of two spars with UFC fighter McGregor.
"This was a push down in sparring, post the whole video, rounds one through 12, unedited," he said.
UFC lightweight title-holder McGregor will make his professional boxing debut when five-weight world champion Mayweather comes out of retirement to face him in Las Vegas on 26 August.
Two-weight world champion Malignaggi had been one of the sparring partners helping to prepare McGregor.
Malignaggi claimed he "beat the breaks off" McGregor during one session, and the Irishman pushed him down out of "frustration".
In a post on Instagram, Malignaggi said he will not give away any of McGregor's tactics but added he will speak about what has "upset" him "in time".
"I came with the best intentions and intended to help out," said Malignaggi.
"It's some of the stuff outside the ring and some ways things were handled in training camp that I didn't agree with and made me come to this decision."
Reacting later to the picture of him on the canvas on Twitter, Malignaggi added: "I came to help this camp out, not to be exploited, now you're going to get the truth."
Retired referee Joe Cortez - who officiated when Mayweather beat Ricky Hatton in 2007 - has been working with the McGregor camp to assist in helping the UFC champion adapt to boxing rules.
Earlier this week, Cortez revealed he had to stop a sparring session between McGregor and Malignaggi because the pair were "out of control".
Prior to joining McGregor's team, Malignaggi told BBC Radio 5 live in May that "not a second" of the 29-year-old's bout with former five-weight world champion Mayweather would be competitive.

It provides access to fibre broadband for the majority of premises not covered by any commercial roll-out of superfast broadband.
Conservative party member Mr Bebb said: "Superfast Cymru is publicly funded and my experience would indicate that the programme is out of control, and there's a lack of clarity in what it will deliver and how it will deliver."

===Input Doc/Src: Four attackers were seen entering the office, followed by heavy gunfire and several explosions.
Five security officers - including a police chief - were among the dead and 26 government officials among the hurt.
A spokesman for the Taliban said they carried out the attack.
The siege ended seven hours after it began and all four gunmen were killed by the Afghan National Security Forces which had surrounded the area.
Police said they rescued the attorney general from his office, which is just 200m (650ft) from the office of the governor of Balkh province.
The governor's aide told the BBC that the governor, Atta Muhammad Nur, was at home when the attack began but was taken to his office to monitor the situation.
In a statement seen by the BBC, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said: "Breaking News: This noon suicide [attackers] stormed office of the attorney and appeal court of Balkh province. Heavy casualties for enemy, battle continues."
The Taliban has targeted Afghanistan's legal system in the past. In June 2013, the group detonated a car bomb in front of the compound of Afghanistan's Supreme Court, killing 17 and wounding 39.
And in December of 2014, Atiqullah Raufi, the chief of the secretariat of Afghanistan's Supreme Court, was assassinated by Taliban gunmen in the west of Kabul.

===Input Doc/Src: But this wasn't any ordinary political programme. To investigate what the women of Scotland want from the independence debate - never mind the outcome - we decided to have an all-female cast of contributors.
This wasn't to alienate the good men of Scotland but to ensure we crammed the programme with as many disparate female voices as possible.
The spark for "What Women Want" was a poll by the influential Scottish Social Attitudes Survey that highlighted a sustained gender gap in voting intentions.
Who? Voters in Scotland will go to the polls to vote on their country's future.
What? They will be asked the yes/no question: "Should Scotland be an independent country?"
When? The vote takes place on Thursday, 18 September, 2014.
For as long as the organisation has asked a question about independence - about 15 years - women have been less keen on voting Yes by a consistent six or seven percent margin. Combine that with the disproportionate number of women who say they are undecided, and you have a societal grouping that could prove pivotal for September's outcome.
We wanted to get to the root of why so many women felt unable to make a decision and why, among those who'd professed an opinion, so many felt independence wasn't the road to travel.
It's easy for people like me who've been interviewing politicians on the referendum debate since Adam was a boy to assume every word of it is fed into Scotland's homes to be analysed and debated, but that's clearly nonsense.
Normal people have other priorities, and it could be argued that because so many women have families or are carers, our lives tend to be more fragmented. It's not that we work any harder, let's just say we often have more plates spinning than men.

===Input Doc/Src: The Bluebirds could receive up to £5m for the Scotland goalkeeper.
But Giles says the 31-year-old is worth at least £8m, underlining Cardiff's malaise in the Championship.
"They are going to get £3.5m and they're selling him on the cheap. And that tells me where the club is going: nowhere," said Giles.
Marshall agreed personal terms with Hull after being omitted from Saturday's Championship defeat by Reading.
The 31-year-old has made more than 280 appearances for Cardiff since arriving from Norwich City for free in 2009.
Cardiff are 17th in the 24-strong division with one win, two draws and two defeats.
Marshall is widely regarded as their star player and Giles, who had two playing stints with the club lasting a combined total of six years, is unhappy at the player leaving.
"I think it's a joke. Personally I think David Marshall is worth £8m, probably more than that to any club," said Giles before Marshall's move was finalised.
"Football today, I hate it, all these stats - they keep going on with stats, but if you look at Marshall's stats, they would without a doubt be better than anyone in the Championship and be a lot better than goalkeepers in the Premier League and they've let him go.
"Probably if Hull win the Premier League they'll get £5m."
"They are going to get £3.5m and they're selling him on the cheap. And that tells me where the club is going: nowhere."
Giles agrees that Cardiff City need a proven goalscorer, but does not believe one will be signed.
"Without a doubt Cardiff need a striker and talking to fans, they're looking for someone to score 15-20 goals a season," he told Radio Wales Sport.
"Well that's not going to happen this year and unfortunately we're looking at a season where if they finish half way, they've done well.
"Is that going to bring your fans back? You'll always get your diehards going, but is that going to get enthusiastic people coming down to Cardiff City Stadium?

===Input Doc/Src: The Sky Blues had warned the academy would be under threat if the rugby club got council permission for the facility at the Alan Higgs Centre.
The football club said it was "not against" Wasps having a facility in the city, but was "bitterly disappointed".
Wasps has said the football club could share the proposed centre.
Coventry City, which leases the land from Coventry Sports Foundation (CSF), has said any reduction in hours its youth players could use facilities may diminish the status of its development programme in the eyes of the Football Association.
Football club chairman Tim Fisher said: "Nobody can tell us what will happen with regard to the scheduling or the facilities that accommodate the academy today.
"We've got nine players in and around the first-team group who all came through the academy."
The planning application was approved with conditions, including over parking and roofing materials.
Wasps Group CEO David Armstrong said it understood "sensitivities regarding the location".
He said the football academy had been offered "use of the indoor kicking barn facility on a commercial basis during set periods" and was keen to hold discussions with the club "about how this may work".
Mr Armstrong said it was open to further talks "with CSF and CCFC about any other ways we might be able to assist" with the academy's future.
A council spokesperson said: "In this case the application seeks to use existing sport and leisure facilities for sport and leisure purposes - planning committee can't make its decision on whether this should be rugby or football.
"If the owners of the site that is currently used by the academy wanted to change that use it would be a private matter between the two parties and is not a planning consideration."
CSF has said it repeatedly invited the football club to meet about the academy's future and that the football club chose not to attend a meeting set up with Wasps last month.

===Input Doc/Src: Warnings are being displayed at bus stops, Tube stations and roadsides in the capital because of "high pollution levels".
Mr Khan said the warnings would help Londoners take "appropriate measures to protect themselves".
Under previous mayor, Boris Johnson, air pollution alerts were available through a subscription text service.
Anyone experiencing discomfort is advised to consider reducing their activity, particularly outdoors.
"This is particularly crucial for Londoners who are vulnerable, such as asthma sufferers," Mr Kahn added.
According to official statistics from the Mayor of London, 9,400 people die from air pollution in London each year.
The alerts are being displayed at 2,500 bus stops and river piers, the entrances of all 270 Tube stations and on 140 signs next to the busiest main roads into London with instructions to switch engines off when stationary to reduce emissions.
The mayor has proposed a series of measures to tackle the problem, including introducing charges for the most polluting vehicles in the Congestion Charge Zone.
King's College London's air quality network describes air pollution in London as "high" due to an area of high pressure over the UK resulting in calm, settled and cold conditions and poor dispersal of local pollutants.
Dr David Green of King's College London said: "Letting people know about the problem is very important.
"The more information, the more action people can take to protect themselves and the more well known the problem the less likely people are to buy that diesel car in the future."

===Input Doc/Src: It was the sixth Olympic gold and 10th medal overall for the 33-year-old.
She finished in one hour 11 minutes and 5.2 seconds to lead home a Norwegian clean sweep with Therese Johaug in silver, 2.6 seconds back and Kristin Stoermer Steira winning bronze.
"It's incredible. I thought it would be hard but I've felt good," she said.
"I knew that I am stronger in the sprints, so I was waiting for them to attack on the last climb.
Bjoergen's gold saw her match the six golds won by Russian cross-country skier Lyubov Egorova, who also won three silvers over her career, and former Soviet speed skater Lidia Skoblikova.
She also matches the 10 medals won by fellow cross-country skiers Stefania Belmondo of Italy and Raisa Smetanina of the Soviet Uniion and the United team, but they have won fewer golds.
Bjoergen, who won three golds in Vancouver, pulled away from Johaug heading into the stadium and sprinted clear to follow up on her wins in the 15km skiathlon and the team sprint classic earlier in the programme.
It was the first clean sweep in Olympic cross-country skiing since Vegard Ulvang led Bjorn Daehlie and Terje Langli for a Norwegian sweep in the men's 30km classic in 1992.

===Input Doc/Src: The first minister has been reflecting on Scottish government proposals for a fresh ballot on the issue in the wake of the general election result.
It saw the SNP lose 21 seats at Westminster after the party's share of the vote fell from 50% to 37%.
But the party's 35 seats meant it remained the largest in Scotland.
The first minister called in March for a second independence referendum to be held in the autumn of next year or spring of 2019, once the results of the Brexit deal are known.
She has insisted a vote was needed to give Scots an alternative to a "hard Brexit" after nearly two-thirds of voters in Scotland backed the UK remaining in the EU.
But she has faced calls from opposition parties to ditch her plans - while some figures from her own party have called on her timetable to be "parked".
Ms Sturgeon discussed a referendum when her cabinet team met in Edinburgh on Tuesday morning.
Her spokesman said afterwards: "There was a discussion led by the first minister on an independence referendum and related issues.
"That forms part of the process she laid out after the election and she will continue to consult with government and party colleagues, and will lay out her views on the way forward in due course."
When asked if this would be before Holyrood breaks up for the summer recess at the close of business on Thursday of next week, he stated: "I think it is likely before then."
The spokesman added there was not "an exact timetable" for when any announcement would be made.
In the immediate aftermath of the general election, Ms Sturgeon conceded her plans for a second independence referendum were "undoubtedly" a factor in the results.
She said at the time: 'We will reflect on these results, we will listen to voters and we will consider very carefully the best way forward for Scotland, a way forward that is in the interests of all of Scotland."
Scottish Secretary David Mundell said at the weekend that he can see "no circumstances" under which an independence refer

===Input Doc/Src: Several Australian bars have dumped Coopers Brewery after it was featured by religious group the Bible Society.
The video shows two MPs debating their opposing views on same-sex marriage - which is not legal in Australia - as they clutch Coopers beers.
It has led to claims Coopers is against marriage equality, a claim it denies.
The backlash has gathered pace in recent days and, by Tuesday, a string of drinking spots in favour of same-sex marriage had boycotted the brand.
The Bible Society posted the "Keeping It Light" video on Thursday. It features conservative MPs Tim Wilson (for same-sex marriage) and Andrew Hastie (against) debating the issue in what they call a "civil and respectful way".
Coopers has since claimed it "did not give permission" to be included in the video. However, the brand recently celebrated the Bible Society's 200-year anniversary with a commemorative beer featuring Bible verses.
In the video, Mr Wilson argues: "I believe that it would be sensible to change the act that deals with issues around civil marriage to include two people regardless of their gender."
Mr Hastie counters: "I'm for retaining the current definition of marriage, which is between a man and a woman."
Despite Mr Wilson's inclusion, critics interpreted the video as one-sided. One commentator said Coopers risked sponsoring a "political act by a religious organisation", while another said "homophobia lite is still homophobia".
"I have respected Coopers all my life, and it was crushing to realise that as a queer person, they don't respect me," wrote Chloe Sargeant for the Special Broadcasting Service.
Opposition to the video has picked up steam since the weekend. By Tuesday, at least eight drinking spots in Sydney and Melbourne had publicly declared they would not stock Coopers. One widely shared video showed two people throwing full bottles in the bin.
Luke Hiscox, from Sydney's Union Hotel, which plans to take Coopers off tap, said people were upset by the phrase "keeping it l

It added that the police found "no evidence at all" and his removal by Northern Rail was a "farce".
The rail operator said it was "confident this dismissal was fair".
Adrian Thompson, human resources director for Northern Rail, added: "We never rush to dismiss our staff. Dismissal is always a last resort."
The union's general secretary Mick Cash said: "There is no compelling CCTV evidence, the police found no forensic evidence and management could come up with very little in anecdotal evidence to support the decision to dismiss Chad."
Northern Rail said it would continue a normal service this weekend despite the 48-hour strike, which started on Saturday midnight.

The husband-and-wife Adcocks beat Danes Joachim Fischer Nielsen and Christinna Pedersen in the mixed doubles final.
Scot Kirsty Gilmour lost in the women's singles final to Carolina Martin.
The Spanish top seed triumphed 21-14 21-12.
It is the first time England have won two golds at the Euros since 1988, when Darren Hall won the men's singles and Gillian Clark claimed the mixed doubles title with Danish partner Steen Fladberg.
The success at the Euros comes after GB Badminton had all its funding cut by UK Sport before the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
Ouseph, who had previously won two bronzes and a silver in the men's singles at the European Championships, is just the third Englishman to win the event with Steve Baddeley the previous player to triumph in 1990.
Between the wins for Baddeley and Ouseph, players from Denmark had won gold in eight out of nine European Championships.
The second-seeded Adcocks took full advantage of their first appearance in a Euros final to see off top seeds Nielsen and Pedersen, who had won the event in the past two Championships.
The Adcocks were pegged back after winning the first set but held their nerve to triumph 21-17 18-21 21-19.

===Input Doc/Src: The gunmen had approached the restaurant from Lido beach on Thursday evening, firing on diners.
Twenty people were killed. Militants also detonated two car bombs nearby.
Al-Shabab said it was behind the attack. The group has carried out frequent assaults on the Somali capital.

Lido beach: Sun, surf and... grenades?
Troops then besieged the attackers at the restaurant for eight hours. It was not immediately clear how many of the militants were killed or captured.
The Somali authorities said the leader of the attack had been arrested.
Prime Minister Omar Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke condemned the killings as "barbaric".
There are varying reports about how the attack started but it appears that as the first car bomb went off, at around 19:30 local time (16:30 GMT) on Thursday, the gunmen stormed the area.
"They randomly fired at the people sitting near the beach before entering the restaurant,'' witness Ahmed Nur told Associated Press.
Twenty people were injured in addition to those killed, police said.
After the evening prayer, I went to Lido beach, in particular Beach View restaurant. When I was there about 30 minutes, and I was spending time with my friends including journalists, we saw bullets raining on us.
A good number of people were seated around me, there was a wedding ceremony at the hall of the restaurant. We started running towards the door, but before I reached it we heard a loud explosion.
I saw some people jumping from the second floor. Bullets were flying all over the place, and there was another explosion. Then everyone got confused. I personally saw three wounded people. I did not see those who have been harmed by the explosions. I think the car was parked near the main door of the restaurant.

===Input Doc/Src: Neil Jackson, 35, of Penylan, Cardiff, posed as a landlord online and took £12,840 from nine people but failed to let the three-bedroom home out.
He took deposits before repeatedly cancelling move-in dates claiming his son was battling cancer and had died.
Jackson previously admitted fraud at Cardiff Crown Court.
Andrew Kendall, prosecuting, said Jackson told his victims he needed £1,400 to secure the property and arrange a move-in date only to later claim he could not drop off the keys to Cardiff because his son was ill in Plymouth.
"He'd say things like he blamed nurses for not stitching his son back properly and even told one victim his son had died," he said.
Mr Kendall said the lies had a "great impact" on some victims, with one couple left homeless and another left living in a caravan.
He also pressured one woman into borrowing money from friends and selling possessions so he could "reserve" the home for her.
Mr Kendall said Jackson was eventually found out when some victims found news reports on him being jailed in 2012 for again using his two-year-old son to defraud £60,000.
The former Tesco store manager tricked his workmates for three years, claiming he had cancer and his son had cerebral palsy.
Staff donated money to pay for private treatment but he used it to fund holidays to Las Vegas and Hawaii.
David Pinnell, defending, said Jackson was "genuinely remorseful" and had used the money to pay off debts to people who protected him in prison.
Jailing him for two years, Recorder of Cardiff Eleri Rees, told him: "You have to understand given your track record for elaborate lies the court finds it hard to take what you're saying at face value.
"Some of the victims were in precarious financial situations so the impact on them has been very serious. Others ended up living in a caravan."

===Input Doc/Src: The roadblocks have caused widespread disruption in all Brazilian states.
The Senate is due to vote on the impeachment on Wednesday. A simple majority in favour of a full trial will suspend Ms Rousseff for up to 180 days.
The government has asked the Supreme Court to suspend the impeachment process for alleged irregularities.
However, similar attempts have been rejected by the court.
Protesters blocked the main access roads to Brazil's largest city, Sao Paulo, causing huge traffic jams during the morning rush-hour.
The protests spread to cities and towns across the country.
Police said there were barricades on 14 highways in Brazil's 26 states and the Federal District, home to the capital Brasilia.
In Rio de Janeiro, which will host the Olympics in August and September, protesters set up barricades at a major road linking the city to the state of Sao Paulo.
In the north-eastern city of Natal, buses did not run in the morning and the road next to the main university was blocked. Classes were suspended.
The anti-impeachment protests were organised by a left-wing umbrella organisation, the Popular Brazil Front, which promised to carry on with its direct action tactics.
"We will fight everywhere to defend democracy. Brazil says no to the coup!" it said in a Facebook message.
President Rousseff has vowed to keep fighting until the end against her impeachment.
On Tuesday, the acting Speaker of the lower house of Congress, Waldir Maranhao, surprised the country when he announced that he had suspended the vote that allowed the impeachment process against her to go ahead.
He said the 17 April vote in the lower house had breached Congress rules. Members had voted overwhelmingly in favour of the impeachment process going ahead.
But within less than 24 hours he had revoked his decision to annul the vote. He gave no reason for his u-turn.

===Input Doc/Src: Not only had there been a tense build-up to the game, given that one of Murray's former coaches, Dani Vallverdu, now works with Berdych, but during the match the Scotsman's fiancee Kim Sears was apparently caught on camera swearing in the opposing camp's direction.
It has all put the spotlight on players' entourages - those close friends and advisers who can be seen sitting in the VIP boxes at big games.
The entourage is the highly motivated family, financial and sporting team driving their man or woman to the top.
As with a rock star or an F1 driver, those behind the scenes form a super-professional and well-drilled team, each with a specific role to play to ensure that the player is as well-prepared and supported as possible - physically, mentally, and financially.
The more cash a player rakes in through prize money and endorsements, the bigger the potential entourage they can employ, with the top stars paying hundreds of thousands of pounds a year on support staff.
The Main Coach
They may not work all year round, but the chief coach is the main sporting point of contact with the player, honing his or her skills to a tournament-ready fine-pitch.
Often, but not always, a former pro themselves who understands the challenges of battling to Grand Slam finals.
They are able to impart the wisdom of their experiences and successes, such as Amelie Mauresmo with Andy Murray, or Boris Becker with Novak Djokovic.
However, Rafael Nadal's coach, his Uncle Toni, was never a top-ranked player, nor was Patrick Mouratoglou, coach of Serena Williams.
The principal coach is often also a defensive shield, and can provide another "public face" to the star.
"Taking an entourage around the world can be incredibly costly," says Simon Chadwick, professor of sports business at Coventry University.
"However, there must be a return on investment because if there was no benefit, particularly given the way these players are so carefully financially managed, then these extensive back-up teams w

===Input Doc/Src: Mr Trump called it a "very precarious" issue for the party and said that Mr Cruz's nomination could be challenged in court.
Mr Cruz was born in Calgary to an American mother and a Cuban father.
Most legal experts believe Mr Cruz meets the requirements to be president.
The Cruz campaign responded by saying Mr Trump had "jumped the shark" - a pop culture reference to when a TV show or fad has overreached and fallen into decline.
The Texas senator is performing well in polling in the early voting state of Iowa. While Mr Trump leads most polls, several surveys show Mr Cruz is the top choice of likely Republican voters.
Much of Mr Trump's support comes from independents, disillusioned Democrats and people who have never voted before.
Some analysts are predicting that Mr Cruz will win because of how the voting process is structured in Iowa.
The caucus format requires more time and dedication from voters than a typical US primary election.
Before Mr Trump became a presidential candidate, the New York businessman had repeatedly questioned President Barack Obama's citizenship.
Mr Obama was born in Hawaii to an American mother and a Kenyan father.
Authorities in Hawaii and Mr Obama both provided detailed birth records after some conservatives such as Mr Trump questioned where he was born.
Mr Obama's allies have said the "birther" movement was a racist effort to discredit the county's first black president.

Food bank manager Michael Nixon said about 1,000 families missed getting food parcels due to the vandalism.
He said a glazier firm had offered to fix the damage for free.
Mr Nixon said the project had also received Â£2,500 in donations.
He said: "We are limping along and are in disarray after having to close for a few days, which meant hundreds of families missing out.
"When I saw the damage I felt like I'd been kicked in the stomach.
"But now my faith in humanity has been restored - a glazier firm has offered their services for free and they will come next week to repair our windows."
Mr Nixon said vandals carried out three separate break-ins in a week and were probably looking for cash to steal.
He said they also "mindlessly" smashed up the hall causing Â£2,000 worth of damage.
As well as food parcels, the bank also provides dozens of free, hot meals every day.

===Input Doc/Src: Deiseane Santiago, 22, became pregnant in January while visiting her fiancé in Kegworth on a five-month visa.
Her attempt for a UK visa extension was initially denied and the Home Office said she would have to return.
However, the Home Office said it was now reconsidering her case.
On Thursday morning, Miss Santiago was told she was no longer at immediate risk of deportation.
A Home Office statement said: "We are in contact with Ms Santiago and are reconsidering her case."
A friend of the couple, Susan Cooke, said: "It is a great relief that 'Daisy' is no longer at risk of the Home Office turning up on Friday to remove her.
"However, we are not out of the woods yet. But for the first time this week, things are looking hopeful. This could actually turn into a success story with a healthy baby being born in the UK."
Miss Santiago's fiancé, Simon Ellis, said he feels "scared and trapped".
"All I want is a safe birth for my baby," he said.
"I don't want a chance for that baby to catch microcephaly and I don't think I should have to take that chance."
Miss Santiago said: "I'm feeling a lot of stress. I'm depressed, I can't eat.
"If it wasn't about this virus Zika and advice of doctors and my mum telling me that I shouldn't go home, I would be home."
Earlier, supporting an application to extend her visa, her GP cited Public Health England advice over pregnant women travelling to Zika hotspots.
Miss Santiago, from São Paulo, met Mr Ellis online three and a half years ago.
She travelled to Kegworth to visit him in November and the couple got engaged about six weeks ago.
The couple changed her return flight to November - after the baby's due date - and applied to have her visa extended until then.

===Input Doc/Src: Most of the passengers are reported to be from Latin America.
The crash happened on Interstate 10 close to the resort town of Palm Springs in the early hours of Sunday morning.
Investigators are examining the cause of the crash, which happened as the bus was bound for Los Angeles.
Rescuers used ladders to climb into the bus windows to remove bodies. Five of the injured passengers are in critical condition.
The Los Angeles Times described the crash as the deadliest in California for several decades. It said that the bus careered into the rear of the truck at high speed, mangling the front third of the bus.
Most of those who died were apparently at the front of the bus, the newspaper reported. The driver was among the fatalities.
Officials quoted by the paper said that identifying the victims could take days, because some were not carrying identity cards or had lost their belongings when they were taken to hospital.
They have warned that it may not be possible to determine exactly why the accident happened because of the driver's death.
Investigators will assess whether he might have fallen asleep or had a heart attack, in addition to determining if there was a mechanical failure or some other kind of emergency.
The westbound lanes of the interstate were closed near the crash site but are now reported to have been reopened.
According to the Desert Sun newspaper, the tour bus, run by US Holiday, was coming from Red Earth Casino, near Salton City in California.
The small Los Angeles-based company, runs trips to casinos in California and Las Vegas. The driver of the bus was one of the owners of the tour company.
The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration records show the company had one vehicle and one driver. According to the data the company held a satisfactory safety rating and had not been in a crash for two years.

===Input Doc/Src: Tree surgeon Jon Sterkel told the BBC he used an explosive rifle target which sent blue smoke billowing into the air.
The blast was reportedly so loud that it was heard nearly 5km (3 miles) away.
Mr Sterkel has apologised after causing a police alert. He said that he was not aware his actions were illegal.
"The explosives I bought are readily available in most department stores, and even most law enforcers I have spoken to are not aware that they are illegal," he told the BBC.
He said that he had detonated exploding targets before on his remote farmland west of Scottsbluff, Nebraska, without upsetting anyone.
How are new babies celebrated around the world?
He said that Saturday's explosion contained blue smoke - caused by chalk powder - to tell the outside world that his wife Ashley is expecting a baby boy.
Mr Sterkel, 26, can be heard proclaiming "it's a boy!" on the video of the explosion which has been widely featured on numerous US websites.
But the blast was so loud that police in nearby Scottsbluff were alerted, with some residents concerned that a major disaster had taken place.
Mr Sterkel said that he immediately called the local sheriff to explain what had happened in addition to  apologising for his actions.
"I would like to say sorry for all of the confusion," he said. "I am a man of character and will willingly go to court if the district attorney chooses to prosecute me.
"This was just our way of announcing what gender our baby was."
Mr Sterkel faces charges for detonating the explosive without a valid permit. There was no damage or injury but he could be punished with a prison sentence and a fine of $1,000 (Â£800).
Police told the Omaha World Herald that although exploding targets, which are detonated when shot with a high powered rifle, have recently become popular, people who use them need to follow the correct procedures.
Mr Sterkel told the BBC that he does not plan any more spectacular blasts once the baby, his first child, is born around 16 June.
---Sum/Tgt: A US man who celebrated news that his wife was expecting a baby boy by setting off an explosion in Nebraska is facing police action which could result in a year in jail and a fine.

===Input Doc/Src: These are some of the scenarios being mooted by an increasingly excited blockchain community.
The technology that underpins the cryptocurrency Bitcoin is nothing new - it's been around for decades. It's just an encrypted database that's distributed across a computer network.
But what makes it different is it can only be updated when everyone on that network agrees, and once entered the information can't be overwritten, making it extremely secure and reliable.
And trust, as we know, underpins most business transactions.
"Blockchain, for perhaps the first time, presents a legitimate threat to the status quo," says Terry Roche, head of financial technology research at financial advisory firm, Tabb Group.
The tech has spawned a new generation of start-ups looking to find new, related applications, from peer-to-peer lending to smart contracts.
For example, OpenBazaar is a way people can sell anything to anyone, anywhere in the world using bitcoins.
Unlike with eBay or Amazon, users don't visit a website but download a programme that directly connects them with other potential buyers and sellers.
"Our goal is to unbundle the incumbent marketplaces around the world by offering a more private, secure and flexible option that isn't controlled by any one corporate interest, but rather, by the users themselves," developer Brian Hoffman tells the BBC.
According to OpenBazaar, cutting out the middleman means there are no fees, no restrictions, no accounts to create, and you only reveal the personal information you feel comfortable sharing.
The software is now in its testing phase and has been downloaded nearly 20,000 times in the last three weeks. Other decentralised marketplace concepts include Syscoin, which is also a digital currency.
Another major development exciting the industry are smart contracts, programmes that can automatically verify that contract terms have been met, and, once that has been done, authorise payment - all in real time without any need for middlemen.

===Input Doc/Src: An image of a Kyrgyz passport purportedly belonging to the suspect circulated on social media.
But Kyrgyz authorities said they had questioned the man and that he had played no part in the attack.
Turkish media have run images of a suspect, saying they were given out by the police.
But the police have given no official details of the search for the suspect.
The passport image circulated on social media shows a similar-looking man to the suspect, but the head of the Kyrgyz security services told the BBC that the passport holder was not involved.
Rakhat Sulaimanov said the man had been questioned by both their agents and Turkish security and that he had nothing to do with the attack.
The Kyrgyz authorities say they were not contacted by their Turkish counterparts about the possible connection. Tairbek Sarpashev from the Kyrgyz state registration service, said they only started to investigate the man in question after seeing the media reports.
Turkish media have said the man police are investigating is from Central Asia and had rented a flat in the central city of Konya with a woman believed to be his wife and two children, who have been detained.
As more details emerge about the Istanbul nightclub gunman, it looks increasingly likely that - unlike most of the attacks in France and Germany last summer - the murderer had at least some rudimentary military training.
Like the IS gunmen who attacked Paris in November 2015 and the jihadists who attacked Mumbai in 2008, he arrived on the scene with several full magazines for his assault rifle, each containing 30 rounds.
Reports from the scene say he fired more than 100 rounds, shooting at the wounded and setting off explosive devices as a distraction as he reloaded. After nearly six years of civil war in Syria, and a still-active insurgency in Iraq, governments in both Europe and the Middle East are deeply concerned that fanatical jihadists who have spent time in those arenas will try to import their lethal skills into other

===Input Doc/Src: The Ministry of Justice announced a new formula for calculating compensation payments for those who suffer long-term injuries, which means insurers will have to increase payouts.
As a result, Direct Line said profits for 2016 had fallen 30% to £353m.
However, it said it had seen strong growth in home and car insurance.
While the changes to compensation calculations affected Direct Line's results for 2016, the company added that it did "not expect any material residual impact on 2017 profit" as a result of the reform.
When the change to the payout formula was announced, a number of insurance companies said their profits would be hit.
The Ministry of Justice said it was reducing what is known as the discount rate from 2.5% to minus 0.75%.
The move will result in more money for the victims of accidents, and so increase costs for insurance companies.
---Sum/Tgt: Insurance company Direct Line has said last week's changes to the way accident victims are compensated has dented pre-tax profits by £217m.

County striker Scott Boden opened the scoring at the wrong end when his header beat Joe Day after 36 minutes.
Shamir Fenelon then headed home eight minutes after the break, before Newport's Medy Elito was sent off with five minutes left for two yellow cards.
"It was disappointing, I don't think we got going from the first whistle, we couldn't get into a rhythm and our passing was poor," Newport manager Feeney told BBC Radio Wales.
"We have to put it to bed and move on to the next game, we are still in a fantastic position to avoid relegation and that is still my aim.

===Input Doc/Src: It is estimated the new law could raise up to Â£1m a year for the Welsh NHS.
The bill's sponsor, Labour AM Mick Antoniw, said it would help people whose lives had been blighted by "this terrible disease".
The insurance industry has raised concerns, questioning whether the move is within the assembly's powers.
Before becoming an assembly member, Mr Antoniw was a solicitor at the legal firm which has acted for many asbestos victims and their families.
Speaking before the bill was passed, he said: "It is only right that medical costs incurred by the NHS should be recovered from those who caused the disease and used to give more support to asbestos victims and their families - for example, a cancer nurse costs Â£50,000 per annum.
"We could employ an additional 20 cancer nurses or a mixture of cancer nurses and counsellors or additional research into the cause and treatment of asbestos disease.
"It is my belief this new Welsh law can make a significant improvement to the quality of life of those whose life is blighted by this terrible disease."
Last December assembly Presiding Officer Rosemary Butler certified that the bill was within the institution's powers, but admitted it was a "finely balanced" decision on some aspects of the legislation.
The Association of British Insurers (ABI) wrote to her and the secretary of state for Wales with a number of what it called "serious concerns" about the bill's lawfulness.

A pilot version with a state-run telecoms company has already been offered at 125 rural wi-fi hotspots.
In a statement, Facebook said the tests were being carried out with "multiple local ISP partners".
Facebook is probably hoping that users who first encounter the web via a Facebook initiative will be more likely to become users of the social network - rather than a competitor - according to Ian Fogg, an analyst at IHS Technology.
"In emerging economies, Facebook is pursuing an intervention strategy to increase the pace of internet and online usage because this will also raise the addressable market for Facebook," he told the BBC.
Earlier this year, Facebook's Free Basics internet service app was blocked by India's telecoms regulator.
A ruling in favour of net neutrality put a stop to the plans, which would have offered free access to a select number of websites only.

===Input Doc/Src: Mason has joined Championship rivals Wolves on a three-and-a-half-year deal for an undisclosed fee.
Hudson played alongside Mason, who scored 22 goals in 60 league starts since joining Cardiff from Plymouth in 2011
"I wouldn't want to see him leave my squad," Huddersfield's Hudson said.
Former Republic of Ireland Under-21 forward Mason had been a target for Wolves in the summer.
"For me it's a strange one why they would need to sell to a rival club, especially another team looking to push into the play-offs," Hudson added.
"I think he's a great player, his movement and the way he ghosts in and out of games. He always hits the target when he gets a chance.
"If he's playing week in, week out I think he's probably going to be one of the top-scorers in the league."
Wolves' Wales midfielder Dave Edwards, who will be out for 12 weeks after having surgery on a foot injury, says Mason would be a "much needed addition" to the squad.
"We're a bit low on numbers at the moment, especially in the forward areas," Edwards told BBC Wales Sport.
"I've always been impressed every time I've seen him.
"I thought he played very well at Molineux a few weeks ago when we were beaten 3-1 [by Cardiff].
"He works hard for the team and hasn't got a bad goalscoring record either. He'll be great for us."

===Input Doc/Src: The news comes on the day that the ASA upheld a complaint by Morrisons that three Aldi adverts were misleading.
But Morrisons said that despite Wednesday's ruling, Aldi had launched another similar price comparison advert which was just as unfair.
Aldi said in response to the new complaint that it believes its new advert fully complies with ASA rules.
Morrisons latest complaint is about a price comparison TV advert tied to the Euro 2016 football competition. "It's clear they haven't changed their ways," a Morrisons spokesman said.
On Wednesday, the ASA ruled that two Aldi TV adverts and one press ad that claimed consumers could make significant savings were misleading.
One TV ad claimed a Â£70 Aldi shop would cost Â£98 at the "big four" supermarkets.
Morrisons and two members of the public complained the adverts did not make it clear Aldi's own-brand products were being compared with branded products.
However Aldi, said comparative advertising was a "well-established principle".
The German discount supermarket chain said consumers were likely to interpret the comparison as intended - the branded and fresh products from Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons shown versus the Aldi products shown.
The ASA said: "We acknowledged that Aldi stated they had not intended the comparisons to represent a 'typical' weekly shop, but to be a comparison between the pictured products only.
"Nonetheless, we considered that was how consumers would interpret the adverts rather than as a representation of the savings which could be made by switching from a largely branded shop to shopping in Aldi, and therefore assessed them on that basis."
Aldi's UK and Ireland chief executive Matthew Barnes said it was "extremely disappointed" with the "ambiguous and inconsistent" decision.
"The use of comparative advertising is a well-established principle and is firmly in the interests of consumers and encourages competition between retailers," he said.
---Sum/Tgt: Supermarket Morrisons is to make a new complaint to the Advertising Standards Authority about discount chain Aldi.

===Input Doc/Src: And now he has become Scotland's only Labour MP by retaining his Edinburgh South seat in the face of an SNP landslide in the Westminster election.
As the chairman of the Foundation of Hearts, a supporters group which helps to fund the club via monthly donations, Mr Murray had a central role in getting the club out of administration.
He was first elected for the seat in 2010 after serving as an Edinburgh councillor between 2003 and 2010 for the capital's Liberton and Gilmerton ward.
Mr Murray has served in parliament as a Parliamentary Private Secretary and Shadow Business Minister. Up until the election in May he was the Shadow Minister for Trade and Investment.
Murray was born to a cooper father and shop worker mother in August 1976.
Brought up in the Wester Hailes area of Edinburgh, he went to Dumbryden primary school, then Wester Hailes Education Centre.
Mr Murray studied social policy and Law at Edinburgh University and graduated with an Honours degree at the age of 20.
He worked to fund his studies with a part-time job in a local fish and chip shop, where he then set up and ran a pizza delivery service.
After graduating in 1997, Mr Murray worked in financial services before setting up an internet television station.
He then started his own event management business running large festival events.  He has also owned a small bar and hotel business, running several premises.
In 2004, Mr Murray organised a charity concert for a Landmine Free World with artists Billy Bragg, Chrissie Hynde, Steve Earle, Joan Baez and Emmylou Harris, which raised more than Â£100,000.
Mr Murray, who lives with his partner Hannah, also organised a student exchange programme in Nepal to fund school buildings and staff.

===Input Doc/Src: The year, of course, was 1996. With England's European Championship campaign ending in penalty defeat, it was tournament debutants the Czech Republic who claimed a place in the hearts of a nation.
From 66-1 outsiders at the start to almost upsetting Germany in the final, the Czechs had come so close to completing the perfect underdog story.
And it all began at Bamber Bridge.
"I was mowing the pitch when I was called in to take a call from a nearby hotel," remembers Russ Rigby, former groundsman, secretary and kitman at the non-league side, who are in FA Cup action this weekend against Kettering Town.
"It was the hotel's manager and he just asked if we would be interested in playing the Czech Republic in a warm-up game for the European Championship."
Rigby recalled he almost dropped the phone in surprise. After all, it is not every day that a team that has never played higher than the sixth tier of English football gets presented with the opportunity to play an international side.
Needless to say the offer was quickly accepted, but why exactly did a team containing emerging talents like Pavel Nedved, Karel Poborsky and Patrik Berger sound out a non-league side from the north west of England for a friendly?
"They were playing Germany in their opening game of Euro '96 at Old Trafford a few days later, so they were based close by," adds Rigby.
"Preston North End had been approached initially but didn't want the game for some reason or another, so they passed on my number."
Dusan Uhrin, the Czech Republic manager, travelled to the Lancashire village to check out the facilities and complete the formalities of arranging the friendly.
"We'd had the pitch relaid. It wasn't perfect but it was all right," says Rigby.
"The Czech manager didn't speak any English so we had to go through an interpreter, but he was happy with the surface.
"He warned us, though, that he didn't want a physical game, otherwise he'd take his players off if it got out of hand."

Protests began almost three weeks ago, after a massive vehicle bomb in the city centre left more than 150 dead.
Demonstrators accuse the government of failing to provide security.
Pledging an investigation into the overnight violence, Afghan Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah said one person been killed and six wounded.
"These kinds of incidents damage the trust between the government and the people," he said.
Demonstrators put the number of dead at two. Street clashes broke out after the authorities demolished the camp. Police responded with live rounds, AFP news agency reports.
Afghan intelligence officials have blamed the 31 May bomb attack on the Haqqani network, a Taliban affiliate with alleged support from Pakistan.
The Taliban and the Haqqani group denied any involvement. Islamabad strongly rejected the claim.
The bombing sparked anti-government protests just days later in which four people were killed, as police used tear gas and fired bullets into the air to keep crowds at bay.
Three suicide bombers then attacked the funeral at the weekend of one of those killed in the protests, killing at least seven people.
The Kabul protest began peacefully the day after the bombing three weeks ago. Demonstrators demanded the execution of Taliban detainees and the sacking of senior security officials.
Soon however fierce critics of President Ashraf Ghani, many of them members of Jamiat Islami which has a 50% stake in the government, took over the protest and violence ensued. They wanted the government dismantled altogether. Police called them rioters who wanted to storm the presidential palace.

===Input Doc/Src: The management gender pay gap stands at an average of £3,188 - or 13%.
Although this is less than the UK average of 22%, the Chartered Management Institute (CMI) said it was still "unacceptable".
The findings are in its annual salary survey of more than 72,000 professionals across the UK.
How big is the gap?
The findings are reflected in the most recent Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures. These show women in professional occupations in Wales received an average of £678 gross pay a week in 2014  - compared to men on £794 a week.
That 15% gap also exists between women and men's pay across all sectors in Wales - and has remained largely unchanged for a decade.
It is slightly better than the UK average - 20% and 19% if you exclude London and the south east.
The ONS said it was a complex issue and prefers we look at median hourly earnings for those in full-time work, which suggests the pay gap is now the lowest on record.
It is now 9.4% between all working men and women - around £100 a week - compared to 17.4% in 1997.
Why does the pay gap exist?
Cardiff University researchers last year found the working patterns of men and women are very different.
"Feminised" jobs attract lower hourly pay rates and have high concentrations of part-time hours, it suggested.
In summary:
The university research team claimed, with little training or career progression opportunities, women can get "stuck" in these working patterns for life.

Forty five years after the UK Government passed the Equal Pay Act, working women in Wales are still earning on average more than £3,000 less than men.  In effect they are working for 34 days each year for free.
In Wales the gap between what men and women earn is less - at 13% - than for the UK as a whole, which is 22%. On the face of it, that may seem to be good news and could be used to suggest that Wales is a more equal society. But it could also be seen as a reflection of the fact

Dundee Sheriff Court heard that Sunnie initially became involved after being "deluded" into thinking that he had won a £200,000 American lottery prize that had not turned up.
Sunnie started taking in cheques that he was told were to cover "European tax liabilities" on his winnings, passing the money on after taking his portion of it.
The 58-year-old's bank accounts were closed down due to "fraudulent activity" and he was twice told by Trading Standards officers that he was helping to facilitate an international fraud.
But he started up his activity again in August 2013, taking in dozens of cheques from three elderly victims over the course of the next year.
He told his trial that a man from the fraudsters he was passing the money to had called him two weeks earlier saying his £200,000 winnings were still on the way, and that he still expected a cheque to come through his door.
Sunnie's lawyer Gary McIlravey admitted that his client was "deluded".
Depute fiscal Muhammad Sadiq, prosecuting, said: "It's clear he may have been a victim at first, but he did then benefit by processing payments on numerous occasions after being told it was a scam."
Sheriff Simon Collins QC convicted Sunnie of money laundering, saying a large number of vulnerable people had been defrauded out of a large sum of money.
The sheriff added: "By any standard the arrangement he entered, even from the outset, was obviously a scam.
"He was told it was a scam and that he was taking part in a fraud and his bank accounts were closed.
"He processed nearly £52,000 but claimed not to have made even inquiries of those involved in these arrangements. This stretches credulity."

He also wrote that Singapore was filled with "stupid people".
Several Singaporean web users contacted his employer, real estate website 99.co, expressing anger at his posts.
During a dispute with another Facebook user, Mr Truyen wrote that "the average IQ" in Singapore would fall if he left the country, and that "locals can't even read".
Darius Cheng, chief executive of 99.co, apologised for Mr Truyen's comments in a blog post, and said his employment contract had been terminated.

"Sonny, as an SEO specialist, has only started consulting for us for a week before the incident happened," Mr Cheng wrote.
"We are a proud Singaporean company and do not condone such language or behaviour, hence we have since terminated his engagement once the incident came to light."
Responding to the online anger at Mr Truyen, Mr Cheng also asked readers not to spread "messages of hate and division, but instead embrace our diversity".
"Anyone labelled a 'Foreign Talent' was heavily criticised" online after the incident, he said. "I am sure we all have Australian or Vietnamese friends - how would they feel if they read it?"
Large numbers of Western expats live in Singapore and Mr Truyen is not the first foreigner to be fired amid a social media furore.

===Input Doc/Src: Unite was responding to Plaid Cymru's economy spokesman Adam Price, who urged steel workers to reject a move from final salary pensions.
Balloting is expected to begin at the end of January.
Tata said pension reform is essential to a deal that would see Â£1bn invested at Port Talbot over 10 years.
The company made a commitment to secure jobs and production at Port Talbot and its other steelworks in December.
But Plaid AM Mr Price said Tata was being "opportunistic", adding workers should ask it to rethink the offer.
The financial climate around the steel industry has changed over the last 12 months.
World steel prices have risen from $385 per tonne of hot rolled coil a year ago, when Tata announced more than 1,000 UK job losses, to $536 per tonne by August just after the company put the sale of its Welsh operations on hold.
China had been accused of selling surplus steel to Europe at below cost price, driving down its market value.
But last summer, the European Union continued imposing tariffs on foreign imports - with up to 22% levied on cold rolled steel, which is used in cars and washing machines.
And the turnaround plan put in place at the biggest plant, Port Talbot, saw the reported losses of Â£1m a day at the site reduced.
Mark Turner, a Unite union official at Port Talbot, said: "When politicians start making comments on either side, they need to understand what they're doing and the influence they have on people.
"There are personal decisions to make but also the future of the steel industry, there are a lot of things people have to take into consideration.
"We'd like politicians to keep their opinions to themselves for the time being."
Meanwhile, Aberavon MP Stephen Kinnock criticised Mr Price, saying he was "astonished" at his intervention, given the delicacy of the situation.
"This is a very personal decision that the steelworkers have to make, based on a range of factors," said the Labour MP.
"There have been some very impressive proposals from Tata Stee

The 1920s landmark was badly damaged and is being dismantled for repair.
Ceredigion council aims to completely re-open the promenade to the public by Easter after it was battered by high tides and storms.
Volunteers had been asked to join the promenade clean-up at 10:00 GMT and more than 200 turned out, with buckets and shovels.
As well as students, one man had travelled from Gloucestershire to help clear shingle from the walkway.
Charlotte Dubenskij reports from Aberystwyth
Children filled their buckets up with scoops of the pebbles brought over onto the promenade by high waves over the last week.
Parents and grandparents monitored their progress as they worked side with shovels and sweeping brushes.
Others looked after those who toiled, offering snacks and drinks for the weary workers.
One woman told me she came to do her bit as her husband found the prom therapeutic.
"He has ill health and the one thing that keeps him going is a walk along here everyday," she said.
There is a real sense of community here as the clean up comes into its final phase.
Elsewhere, the A487 in Newgale, Pembrokeshire, has been reopened after tonnes of shingle washed onto it during the storm.
Engineers spent several days using earth moving equipment to move the shingle off the road and back onto the beach.
But it was Aberystwyth that was hardest hit by the heavy rain, strong winds and high tides.
The town's shelter partly fell into a hole after its foundations were washed away as massive waves pounded the seafront on 6 January.
Cadw, the body which looks after Wales' historic monuments for the Welsh government, has told Ceredigion council it wants the shelter to be repaired and replaced in its current position.

Pre-tax profits also fell substantially, from £21.3m to £6.6m.
Celtic were knocked out of the Champions League in August after losing to Slovenian side Maribor. They are currently playing in the UEFA Europa League.
The club also cited lower gains from the sale of players as a reason for the poorer trading performance.
Revenues from multimedia and other commercial activities fell from £19.5m to less than £8m, while merchandising revenues also dropped.
In a statement, chairman Ian Bankier said: "As in previous years, the second half is expected to be more challenging in terms of financial performance with fewer home matches scheduled and no certainty on any further gains on the disposal of player registrations.
"Our strategy remains to live within our means.
"The football environment in Scotland continues to be challenging and we must operate within it in a fashion that does not unduly risk the long term future of this great club.
"Our key focus for the remainder of the year will be to build on the progress we have made in the first half of the season and to deliver silverware from competing in the three domestic competitions and remain competitive in the UEFA Europa League."

===Input Doc/Src: Last month Oldham denied reports they were set to offer the 26-year-old a contract, or let him train with them, but it is believed they have now had a change of heart.
Striker Evans has been without a club since he left prison in October.
The Wales international served half of a five-year term for raping a woman in a hotel in May 2011.
An online petition against Oldham signing Evans was set up on Sunday and had been signed by almost 19,000 people by 23:30 GMT.
Former Oldham player Rick Holden told BBC Radio 5 live he was "not comfortable at all" with the possibility of Evans joining the Latics.
"It's one of those crimes that will never go away," said Holden, who played 189 games for Oldham between 1989 and 1993.
"I don't see how the chap can survive given the ferocity of football up and down the land."
Holden, who played 189 games for Oldham between 1989 and 1993, said the club were "courting controversy", but added that they had "a history of taking on these difficult challenges".
Earlier on Sunday, Professional Footballers' Association chief executive Gordon Taylor had revealed that an unnamed club would hold a news conference regarding Evans on Monday, although he added that the player has yet to be signed.
"We've had a number of steps forward and a number of steps back. I'm not going to count my chickens," Taylor told BBC Radio 5 live's Sportsweek programme.
"If a club are looking to sign him they need to be 100% committed."
If Oldham were to sign Evans it would not be the first time they have signed a striker who had served a prison sentence. In 2007 they signed Lee Hughes after he had served half of a six-year prison term for causing death by dangerous driving.
In November, Oldham chairman Simon Corney told BBC Radio Manchester that he felt people should be given a "second chance".

===Input Doc/Src: Cherryl Henry-Leach from Doncaster Children's Services Trust, which runs Getting On, said it was one of the only programmes of its kind in the UK.
Families work with police, the health service, voluntary sector and council to avoid violence at home.
Ms Henry-Leach said parents were often reluctant to get help.
"They feel shame and stigma attached to being a victim of domestic abuse, while also fearing the consequences for their child if reported," she said.
The programme seeks to stop children moving from one abusive relationship to another, using a "whole-family approach" unique to Doncaster to build families' self-esteem and resilience, Ms Henry-Leach said.
Many teenagers on the programme have lived with domestic violence between parents so the project attempts to "de-normalise" abuse and help them move on to healthier relationships.
Mother and son, Anne and Luke (not their real names) from Doncaster, said the techniques derived from University of Oxford research taught them how to listen.
"There was a lot of swearing and abusive behaviour before," Anne said.  "Luke never actually hit me, but he'd go to hit me, or push me which could be frightening.
"I can now sit down and talk to my son without us shouting at each other. We can actually have a conversation without being abusive.
Luke agreed that they have a "healthier relationship."
Five Doncaster families have now completed the nine week programme, which is funded by Â£3.1m from the Department for Education's Innovation Fund.

===Input Doc/Src: However, Health Minister Michelle O'Neill said no such plan was being considered.
Charles and Elma Hamilton's son, Ian, took his own life in 2013.  He was 38 and a father of two children.
He had suffered from mental health problems for many years.
An inquest heard that 24 hours before his death, Ian had been to three hospitals in two different health trusts.
Ian was first diagnosed with depression in 1998. He was deeply troubled and had problems with alcohol and drug addiction.
However, his post-mortem showed no sign of substance abuse.
His parents said the establishment of a single trust to deal with people with psychiatric conditions could help other people in the future.
The couple believe a single system would help ensure that a patient's notes, capturing their full history, would be accessible to all medics, no matter where they showed up for help.
Charles Hamilton said part of the problem for Ian was that he moved between health trusts.
"I think if they had a single mental health trust, where everything was collated together, all the information concerning the people presenting with mental health problems would be there there at the push of a button," he said.
"That way, professionals can access the patient's history and there are no delays in getting that patient treatment."
Elma Hamilton said Ian's final hours were very distressing.
"He went to three hospitals in two trusts inside 24 hours, trying to get help, pleading with people trying to get his point across," she said.
"He was frustrated and hopeless - he just couldn't get the answers he needed. In one hospital, he was waiting 10 hours to see someone from a mental health team.
"In a different hospital, he self-harmed. He was tired having to go through the same story so many times to different people."
His story highlights how, too often, there is a lack of joined up thinking between mental health services and how sometimes an emergency department is not the best place to treat those with a serious psycho

"In the past two years the project has revealed many ornate and historic features which are unique to the UK.
"As the work progressed the scope was widened to account for additional structural issues which were previously not evident in initial assessments and which led to the schedule and budget being extended.
"This included the exposure of rotten wood in the building's four towers which were found underneath the slates and lead last summer that had to be replaced."
The spokeswoman added: "We made a commitment to bring this important civic building back to life and are delighted the project has now come to a close.

===Input Doc/Src: More than 6,800 people have been killed and 35,000 injured since March 2015, the majority in air strikes by a Saudi-led multinational coalition that backs the president.
The conflict and a blockade imposed by the coalition have also triggered a humanitarian disaster, leaving 80% of the population in need of aid.
The conflict has its roots in the failure of the political transition that was supposed to bring stability to Yemen following an uprising that forced its longtime authoritarian president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, to hand over power to Mr Hadi, his deputy, in November 2011.
Mr Hadi struggled to deal with a variety of problems, including attacks by al-Qaeda, a separatist movement in the south, the continuing loyalty of many military officers to Mr Saleh, as well as corruption, unemployment and food insecurity.
The Houthi movement, which champions Yemen's Zaidi Shia Muslim minority and fought a series of rebellions against Mr Saleh during the previous decade, took advantage of the new president's weakness by taking control of their northern heartland of Saada province and neighbouring areas.
Disillusioned with the transition, many ordinary Yemenis - including Sunnis - supported the Houthis and in September 2014 they entered the capital, Sanaa, setting up street camps and roadblocks.
In January 2015, the Houthis reinforced their takeover of Sanaa, surrounding the presidential palace and other key points and effectively placing Mr Hadi and his cabinet ministers under house arrest.
The president escaped to the southern port city of Aden the following month.
The Houthis and security forces loyal to Mr Saleh then attempted to take control of the entire country, forcing Mr Hadi to flee abroad in March 2015.
Alarmed by the rise of a group they believed to be backed militarily by regional Shia power Iran, Saudi Arabia and eight other mostly Sunni Arab states began an air campaign aimed at restoring Mr Hadi's government.

Mr Osborne questioned the wisdom of quoting backbenchers in a dig at the unrest in Labour ranks.
He also pledged £50m in flood relief.
Mr Cameron is attempting to secure reforms to the UK's relationship with the EU before holding an in-out referendum by the end of 2017.
Ms Eagle, who was greeted with loud cheers as she stood up at the despatch box, said Mr Cameron had been "jetting all over the place" on his "seemingly endless European tour", adding to laughter from Labour ranks: "Can I ask the chancellor: How's it all going?"
"The good news is we have a leader who is respected abroad," replied Mr Osborne, saying the PM was "fighting for a better deal for Britain, something that would never have happened had there been a Labour government".
George Osborne, the bookies' favourite to replace David Cameron as Conservative leader, was then asked whether he really aspired to be "the first post-EU prime minister" by Ms Eagle, who quoted some Eurosceptic Conservative MPs as being "pretty unimpressed by how it's going".
She then imitated Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's PMQs approach of reading out questions from emails he has received.
In this case it was "Donald from Brussels" - a reference to EU Council president Donald Tusk, who warned of the "destabilising" effect of uncertainty over the UK's future in Europe in a letter to fellow EU leaders this week.

Rodney Brown nodded in from a Brad Lyons cross to put the Bannsiders ahead but the Blues hit back with Aaron Burns heading home the equaliser.
Matthew Clarke's side-foot finish moved Linfield in front before Coleraine defender David Ogilby was sent-off for two yellows on 67 minutes.
Jamie Mulgrew poked in Linfield's third as they maintained their 100% record.
Coleraine made the early running and were rewarded on 23 minutes when Brown scored against his former club with a downward header into the bottom corner.
Blues forward Guy Bates had almost sent a clearance into his own net and headed wide of the Coleraine goal before he set up Linfield's two first-half goals.
His dinked cross picked out the unmarked Burns as the midfielder netted his fifth goal of the campaign while Clarke rifled home from a tight angle at the back post.
Lyons saw his goalbound shot deflected over by Sean Ward before Clarke's goal while Brown went close twice before the break.
A dull second half came to life when Ogilby was controversially dismissed after the defender appeared to make minimal contact with Andrew Waterworth.
Linfield capitalised with the extra man two minutes later - substitute Mulgrew jinked into the box before prodding the ball beyond keeper Michael Doherty.

His body was laid out at the headquarters of the opposition Liberal party in the capital, Asuncion.
They condemned the killing and called for an investigation into his death.
Around 200 protesters were detained but many have since been released.

It follows the crash of Malaysia airliner MH17 in Ukraine and growing tensions between Russia and the west.
Ms Moon, who sits on the Commons defence committee, called for a halt in a decline on defence spending.
A total of 298 people were on board MH17, when it was reportedly hit by a missile over a rebel-held area in Donetsk region on Thursday.
Ukraine and the pro-Russian rebels have accused each other of shooting down the Boeing 777, which was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur.
Western countries have criticised restrictions imposed by rebels at the crash site, and have asked Russia to pressurise them to allow more access.
Ms Moon said the "callous" behaviour of militia followed the annexation of Ukraine adding that Russian president Vladimir Putin had to realise that the "world is outraged".
She said: "I think we have to act as if we're entering a new Cold War.
"We've had Russian ships, we have had Russian submarines off our coast for the last few years.
"We've had Russian planes entering very close to our airspace for years, testing our defences.
"We've got no maritime patrol capability - that needs to be replaced."
Ms Moon, who is also part of the Nato Parliamentary Assembly, told BBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement Britain had ignored Russia's "flexing of its muscles".

===Input Doc/Src: He also won four Mobo awards, co-wrote an album with Mary J Blige and scooped an astonishing six Grammy nominations.
The 22-year-old, from Cambridgeshire, is the son of a London banker who was fired for spending too much time trying to jumpstart her offspring's pop career.
He got his break singing on other people's songs - Latch, by dance act Disclosure, and La La La by soul producer Naughty Boy - before scoring his own record deal.
Much has been made of his soaring, multi-octave vocals but his technical abilities never mask his emotions.
In the Lonely Hour was love letter to a man who never returned Smith's affections, and its honesty spoke to record-buyers in their millions.
Ahead of the announcement of the Sound Of 2015 next week, the singer reflects on the highs and lows of his first year in the spotlight.
I had hopes of number ones, but I never thought it would actually happen.
When you come from being a featured artist there's a sudden fear: "Oh God, was it me that people liked - or was it Disclosure and Naughty Boy?"
So when Money On My Mind came out, it was a reassurance - a boost of confidence for me. Just letting me know "things are good, people like your songwriting".
That will never happen again - going to the Brit Awards knowing you already have a Brit Award. It was the first time I'd ever been, and I was number one that week. That was very, very surreal for me. I really celebrated hard that night.
SNL was the scariest moment of my life, ever. It was the first time I played Stay With Me or Lay Me Down on television.
I don't think I'll ever be that scared again...  Four million people watching and no-one knew who the hell I was. Four days previous to the SNL performance, I remember reading tweets from people saying "who the f is Sam Smith?" [laughs]
But it changed my life. You could feel it the morning after. I walked out of my hotel and people recognised me. Stay With Me went to number two on iTunes. It was mental.

France's Kevin Mayer took silver with 8,834, while Canada's Damian Warner secured bronze with 8,666.
"To win two Olympic golds in a row like Daley and Mathias is very special," said Eaton.
"One day, I'm going to have to meet Daley, shake his hand and thank him for giving me something to chase after.
"My throwing has been bad in the past, but I really got after the discus and shot here. Can I do three in a row? Maybe you should ask Daley."
Eaton was the overwhelming favourite to follow Thompson's achievement from 1980 and 84 and is the third multi-eventer, alongside American heptathlete Jackie Joyner-Kersee, to win back-to-back Olympic titles.
He has dominated the event since 2011, claiming back-to-back world titles and twice setting new world records along with his Olympic success.

===Input Doc/Src: Seven protesters were arrested overnight outside the immigration office where she was being held.
Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos, 36, a mother of two US-born children, crossed the southern border from Nogales, Arizona at 10:00 local time.
Protesters had tried to block vehicles transporting her, but were unable.
On Wednesday night, protesters, who feared her deportation under President Donald Trump's clampdown on immigration, blocked a van believed to be carrying Ms de Rayos.
It was one of several vehicles stopped from leaving the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) centre on Wednesday evening.
"Seeing my mom in that van... it was unexplainable. It was really heart-dropping," her daughter Jaqueline said during a press conference after the deportation was announced.
"No one should ever go through the pain of having their mom taken away from them, or the pain of packing her suitcase," the 14-year-old said through tears.
According to US media Ms de Rayos was arrested in 2008 during a raid on her workplace and was convicted of identity theft for possessing false papers.
But she was allowed to continue living in Arizona as long as she checked in with her local ICE office in Phoenix every six months, the report adds.

===Input Doc/Src: Vehicle examiner Philip Balderstone said he could reach the brake with his foot - but only by hand when he was standing without a seatbelt on.
The fatal accident inquiry (FAI) has heard two crewmen on board during the crash were seated with their belts on.
The inquiry is examining the lorry, its route and driver Harry Clarke's health.
Mr Balderstone was giving evidence on the third day of the FAI, which is being overseen by Sheriff John Beckett QC at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
The vehicle examination consultant, who works for the Transport Research Laboratory, was asked to produce a report on the bin lorry following the crash on 22 December last year.
The court has already heard that the front driver section of the lorry cab and the rear crew section was separated by a metal bar.
Mr Balderstone's report noted that the vehicle had an emergency stop button for its rear machinery.
This, however, was not connected to the chassis or drive of the lorry, meaning it could not stop the vehicle.
The court was then shown a picture of Mr Balderstone in the vehicle cab, trying to reach the parking brake control from the rear crew section.
Mr Balderstone confirmed that he was able to reach the brake lever from the rear area and apply it "reasonably easily".
The court has previously heard that the two rear-seated crewmen on the day of the crash, Matthew Telford and Henry Toal, made no attempt to apply the brake and believed they could not reach it.
Mr Balderstone said he is 5ft 8in tall and could reach the parking brake "comfortably".
Solicitor General Lesley Thomson, Scotland's second most senior law officer, who is leading the FAI, then asked if someone who was 5ft 3in tall could reach the brake - this is the height that Mr Telford gave for himself during evidence on Wednesday.
Mr Balderstone said it would be more difficult, but could not say for sure if it would be possible.
The court heard that his report recorded the brake as being 0.71m from the top of the metal bar separating t

===Input Doc/Src: He is to be prosecuted in relation to the internet broadcast of a sermon he delivered at the Whitewell Tabernacle, Belfast in May 2014.
He told BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme: "I don't want to go to jail, but I am prepared to go.
Pastor McConnell said he was defending the right to free speech.
"I believe passionately in the word of the Lord Jesus Christ and I am fighting for a principle."
In May 2014, the pastor delivered a sermon in which he described Islam as "heathen" and "satanic".
After the sermon was posted online, complaints led to a police investigation.
The evangelical preacher later issued a public apology for any offence caused.
The Public Prosecution Service says Pastor McConnell was offered an informed warning but he refused it.
While an informed warning is not a conviction, it is recorded on a person's criminal record for 12 months.
Anyone who refuses to accept it can be prosecuted.

===Input Doc/Src: The BHA aims to halt a decline in the number of horses taking part in races lower down the scale with an increase in prize money and appearance fees.
The scheme has the support of the Racecourse Association and Horsemen's Group.
The proposals come as the 2018 fixture list is released, with 1,508 meetings next year, 11 more than in 2017.
Richard Wayman, chief operating officer for the BHA, said: "Although there has been growth in total prize money in recent years, much of this has been at the top end. The returns to our sport's participants further down the scale are simply not sufficient at present to be sustainable.
"Targeting grassroots with extra funding will help racing's participants to maintain their involvement in the sport, keeping more horses in training, as well as helping with the recruitment and retention of staff to care for our horses."
The BHA proposes to invest additional levy income in racing from 2018, with the aim of delivering three key objectives for the sport - supporting ownership, delivering more competitive and compelling racing, and increasing customer engagement.
A statement by the BHA proposed that, in addition to the increased number on meetings next year, there will also be "customer-friendly slots on Friday evenings and Saturday afternoons throughout summer with the aim of increasing attendances".
"We need the fixture list and race programme to work in a manner that meets our customer's requirements. As customer and betting habits change it is essential that our sport evolves with them," Wayman added.

===Input Doc/Src: The sleepy and nondescript town of 40,000 people ringed by farms sees activity only around its bus stand. Just a couple of trains arrive at its deserted railway station every day.
But this unremarkable place, 275km (170 miles) from the Indian capital, Delhi, is in news these days: it is the first town in India to offer full and cheap wi-fi coverage.
A few cities in India - Bangalore, Pune, Cochin, Delhi - have some public free wi-fi hotspots, but their impact is low.
From the bus stand and railway station to the streets and town market, the residents of Bhadra are now connected to the internet.  I tested it along the length of the town and experienced a seamless connection.
Local businessman Dalit Kumar Jain says he is pleased that he can now quickly download full-length movies on his phone and conduct business-related online money transfers.
The facility is a success among the students, who no longer have to rush to the main town of Hanumangarh, 160km (100 miles) away, for online lessons, job applications and alerts. The number of training centres for job tests has gone up in Bhadra after wi-fi arrived here in July.
Students of the local secondary school say they download exam test papers from the internet, and spend a lot of time on online games, and social media.
For a place which had just a few internet connections a few months ago, Bhadra is a good example of how cheap and speedy wi-fi can change people's lives - 1GB of data only costs 64 rupees (98 cents; 64p) every month.
Sandeep Yadav of MTS India, a Rajasthan-based company responsible for providing the facility, describes small, developing towns like Bhadra as the "nerve-centres of aspirational India".
"Even the residents of small towns are now learning to use data and smart phones. A place like Bhadra accounts for 160GB of data usage every day. This is why we think that a certain amount of free bandwidth would really benefit the inhabitants."
The company plans to roll out wi-fi services in 11 more small to

Currie's anticipated appointment was confirmed at Shamrock Park on Monday evening as his five-year stint as Ards manager came to an end.
The Portadown native, 44, emerged as the club's preferred candidate over the past week.
Currie, who has been handed an 18-month contract, takes over a side that are 13 points adrift at the bottom of the Premiership table.
Portadown started the season with a 12-point deduction for making irregular payments to players and were also handed a number of fines, in addition to being prevented from signing players on professional deals this season.
Despite the team's predicament, the new manager described his appointment as the "pinnacle for me".
"I was in a strong position and a secure job at Ards, but my heart led me here. The lure of coming home and managing my hometown club was too strong," said Currie at the news conference confirming his appointment.
"We're going through a tough time at the moment but I want to bring a smile back to this club.
"Our first priority is doing our utmost to stay in the league and we want to give it a real rattle."
Currie has arrived from Ards with long-term assistant Jay Willis while Trevor Williamson will remain part of the backroom team.
One of the new manager's first acts has been to recall former Linfield striker Mark McAllister to the first-team squad.
Back in September, then manager Pat McGibbon told McAllister that he was no longer part of the club's plans.
However, Currie believes the striker can be an asset to the squad.
"He's looking forward to playing and getting himself fit," said the new manager.
"We've got some good defenders and some good midfielders but I think we need to inject a bit of pace into the last third of the pitch."
A statement from Ards on Monday night said that the North Down club had received "an amount of compensation from Portadown for Currie's services" but that there would be "further discussions between the two clubs".

Critics say this could be an attempt to quell fears about the extent of her illness and mobilise her supporters.
The chief minister was last seen in public on 21 September and admitted to hospital a day later.

Initially, doctors said the 68-year-old was receiving treatment for "fever and dehydration". She was placed under observation and her diet was monitored. But since then there has been a fierce veil of secrecy around her health.
Last Saturday her doctors reportedly said she had "completely recovered" and would go home "whenever she feels fit".

===Input Doc/Src: Contact with flight MH370, carrying 239 people, was lost en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Despite an extensive search no trace has ever been found.
The trial system enables planes to be tracked every 15 minutes, an increase on the current 30 to 40 minutes.
It uses technology already installed on most long-haul jets.
The system is expected to increase the tracking rate to five minutes or less if there is any deviation from a plane's expected route.
Australian Transport Minister Warren Truss said the new system was a "world first". But he stressed the new technology would not necessarily have solved the mystery of MH370.
"It would have been very difficult, one would imagine, without knowing what precisely occurred in the case of MH370, to have intervened from outside," he said.
"But at least it would have tracked the aircraft to within 15 minutes."
Airservices Australia Chairman Angus Houston, who helped lead the search for MH370, agreed it was "no silver bullet".
"But it is an important step in delivering immediate improvements to the way we currently track aircraft while more comprehensive solutions are developed," he added.
The trial will begin in the Australian city of Brisbane, before being extended to Indonesia and Malaysia.
Investigators searching for MH370 are focusing on an area of the Indian Ocean off the coast of western Australia.

===Input Doc/Src: Mr Kejriwal spent Monday night in the open and conducted business with cabinet members from the street.
His administration had accused the police of failing to deal with an alleged drugs and prostitution ring - something they denied.
The chief minister says he has won concessions from central government.
By Soutik BiswasIndia correspondent
India's Arvind Kejriwal's 'anarchic' politics
The government, which commands Delhi's police force, has agreed to send on leave two police officers Mr Kejriwal wants suspended on allegations of misconduct.
"I'm very happy today. Today the people of Delhi have won. I want to congratulate the people of Delhi," AFP news agency quotes Mr Kejriwal as telling supporters.
The protest began on Monday when Mr Kejriwal was prevented from going to the home minister's office to demand the officers' suspension.
He was acting in response to an incident which threatened to become a diplomatic issue, putting his Aam Aadmi Party, the police and members of Delhi's African community at loggerheads.
Last Wednesday Mr Kejriwal's Law Minister, Somnath Bharti, and various party supporters allegedly confronted four Ugandan women in a Delhi neighbourhood, accusing them of prostitution.
Police refused to search a nearby house for evidence of the suspected drugs and prostitution ring because they did not have a warrant.
Mr Bharti and supporters of the Aam Aadmi Party were accused of threatening and intimidating the women, forcing their way into homes and making racist remarks - allegations they deny.
Mr Kejriwal's wider demands include police reform and transferring control of Delhi's police force from the federal authorities.
The chief minister also accuses the police of failing to protect women, following the fatal gang-rape of a student in December 2012.
The Aam Aadmi Party, or Common Man's Party, performed unexpectedly well in state elections on an anti-corruption platform, propelling Mr Kejriwal to the post of chief minister last month.

===Input Doc/Src: Inspectors said the "innovative and radical" work with prisoners' children at HMP Parc, Bridgend, was "probably the best we have seen".
It opened a 60-bed family interventions unit in 2010.
The Prison Officers Association (POA) said more staff and resources would help continue the work.
Prison inspectors reported on two unannounced visits they made at G4S-run Parc prison late in 2015 and early this year.
They found its work with families encouraged prisoner involvement with the lives of their child.
The family interventions unit at the privately-run prison, one of the largest in Wales and England, provides a range of programmes and activities for inmates aimed at helping them to maintain and improve their family relationships.
The prison has also worked with Barnardo's Cymru for about 10 years with the aim of making a visit to the jail less challenging for the children of fathers inside.
Inspectors said: "A prison analysis suggested that 69% of prisoners at Parc received regular visits compared with an average of 48% across the rest of England and Wales."
HMP Parc, which is also a young offenders' institution, houses more than 1,600 prisoners.
BBC Radio Wales current affairs programme Eye on Wales was given access to one intervention - a nursery rhyme session for fathers with young children hosted by the prison's charity-sector partner.
The men on the Rhyme Time session are inside for a range of offences including violence and drugs.
One of them told the programme: "My daughter was born while I was here, so I haven't had the chance to get a bond with her apart from being on groups like this.
"Through all these visits, the bond has come. Looking to when you actually get out the gates, from me never seeing my daughter on the outside, ever, I know she already knows that I'm her father and someone special in her life."

The BBC has also learned that some candidates have been offering bribes of up to $1.3m (£1m) to secure votes.
Indirect elections have been taking place since October as the country remains too unsafe for a national vote.
Much of the country is still under the control of Islamist militant group al-Shabab, which is affiliated to al-Qaeda.
Gen Nur told the BBC Somali Service that some seats should be re-run because money had been used to "out-manoeuvre" other candidates, in some cases, meaning all but one candidate had withdrawn.
Cases of government resources being used in the election have also been documented, he said.
The elections are being funded by the United Nations which also supports the government based in the capital, Mogadishu.

The 41-year-old took over from Kate Thornton in 2007 as host of the popular talent show.
The presenter and broadcaster currently presents a show on Radio 2 and recently completed a 24-hour dance challenge for Comic Relief.
"I'd like to wish the team all the best for the future, especially whoever takes over from me," O'Leary continued.
"You're about to be the conductor on the most brilliant, runaway train in showbiz. Good luck you'll love it!"
The news of his departure may fuel speculation that O'Leary is a contender to replace Jeremy Clarkson on the BBC's Top Gear.
Before Friday's announcement, William Hill had O'Leary as 6-1 to take over following the BBC's decision not to renew Clarkson's contract earlier this week.
Before The X Factor, O'Leary hosted Big Brother's Little Brother, Channel 4's companion show to its long-running reality show.
He has presented on BBC Radio 2 since 2004 and has hosted the National Television Awards since 2010.
Bookmakers Ladbrokes have made singer Olly Murs, a former X Factor runner-up, favourite to take over the vacant presenting role.
A spokesman for ITV said O'Leary had been "a fantastic host of The X Factor" and that the channel was "sorry to see him go".

===Input Doc/Src: The New Syrian Army (NSA) said it had captured a number of IS positions on the outskirts of Albu Kamal, after overrunning a nearby military airport.
However, a raid into the town launched at dawn is reported to have been repelled by militants.
The offensive, which began on Tuesday, is aimed at cutting a key route between IS-controlled areas in Syria and Iraq.
The NSA said it was co-ordinating the assault with Iraqi government forces, who were advancing on the border from the other side.
Several hundred rebels are reportedly involved in the attack on Albu Kamal, just a few kilometres from the Iraqi border in Deir al-Zour province.
The NSA and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, both said on Wednesday morning that the rebels had taken control of Hamdan airport, about 5km (3 miles) north-west of the town.
Fighting was continuing between the two sides in agricultural areas around the town, and coalition warplanes were conducting air strikes on IS hideouts in the town, according to the Syrian Observatory.
NSA spokesman Mozahem al-Saloum told the Associated Press that airborne fighters had also been dropped onto the southern edge of Albu Kamal.
Later on Wednesday, the NSA issued a statement saying its forces had "conducted a deep penetration raid" into Albu Kamal.
"At this time fighting is still ongoing, but the NSA maintains control of the desert, the approaches to Albu Kamal, and maintains freedom of manoeuvre," it added.
The Reuters news agency cited two rebel sources as saying that the NSA had been forced to retreat to the outskirts after an IS counter-attack.
One of the sources said militants had encircled the rebels in a surprise ambush. The rebels had incurred heavy casualties and lost some of their weapons, the source added.
As the rebels advanced on Albu Kamal, IS released a video showing militants beheading five young men in the town who they claimed were working with the NSA, the Syrian Observatory said.

===Input Doc/Src: The Belfast women alleged they were abused over a three-year period in the late 1990s, when they were teenagers.
They claim the case was delayed because prosecutors gave precedence to a separate court case, involving allegations made by MÃ¡iria Cahill.
The PPS said the decision had been made by the court and not them.
The women said they had been "utterly let down by the criminal justice system".
Both women, who have retained their right to anonymity, released a statement through their solicitor, outlining the background to their case and the delays they faced in bringing the matter to court.
The two women said they first reported the alleged abuse to the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) in January 2010.
They said their case was "constantly adjourned" and then postponed two days before the trial was due to begin.
In November 2012, the women's legal representatives made complaints about the handling of the prosecution case to the Public Prosecution Service (PPS), the Office of Attorney General and the Department of Justice.
The solicitor said that shortly after a meeting with police and prosecutors in December 2012, during which there was a "frank exchange of views", the two women "reluctantly withdrew their statements".
The statement issued on behalf of two women said: "They had lost all faith and trust in the criminal justice system and believed they were being exploited, merely for political point scoring."
The statement also made reference to appointment of Keir Starmer QC to lead an independent review of three prosecution cases linked to Ms Cahill's allegations.
The women questioned the independence of the review and called for clarification on its powers and terms of reference.
Five people accused in connection with the cases linked to Ms Cahill's allegations were all acquitted in court.

===Input Doc/Src: The ex-Newcastle and Spurs midfielder failed to secure the backing of five football associations, a requirement for standing in the election to head football's world governing body.
"Unfortunately I will not be able to continue with my Fifa presidential candidacy," 47-year-old Ginola said.
Current president Blatter, 78, is bidding for a fifth term in office.
Dutch football chief Michael van Praag and former world player of the year and Barcelona winger Luis Figo have already named their five backers.
The Football Association has declared its support for Asian federation member Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein.
Prince Ali has said he has the required support for the vote on 29 May.
In order to stand for election, candidates must have also played an active role in football administration in two of the past five years.
Ginola's campaign received £250,000 backing from a leading bookmaker.
Among his ideas were for the men's and women's World Cups to be played at the same time.
"Today I have mixed emotions," said Ginola. "There is disappointment, anger but there is also hope. I'm very proud of my campaign and the policies I proposed to reform football.
"If in the coming months and years even one of my ideas is discussed at the highest level then this will be a victory."

"He's got a great attitude, he wants to win, he wants everything badly because he's not been playing regularly for a few years," Nicholson told BBC Devon.
"He feels like he's got a point to prove and a career to save."
Racchi was released by National League North side Tamworth in December, having begun the season at Halifax.
Torquay are still three points from safety with a game on hand after a 0-0 draw with high-flying Braintree on Tuesday.
"He's been solid since he came here," added player-manager Nicholson, who has not featured in a league game since the Gulls' recent good form began.
"He's got a calming influence on the ball, that was one reason why I felt the time was right for me to come out of the team because I always like to see that as part of what I bring.
"Well Danny does that from the middle of the pitch now, so I can have dynamic full-backs now in the two that we've got and it's made a real difference."

The bank said the ECB had given it until 3 October to draw up a plan for reducing non-performing loans.
Italian banks are saddled with €360bn (£300bn; $400bn) of bad debt, about a third of the eurozone's total.
Monte dei Paschi accounts for €46.9bn of that total.
In a draft decision sent to the bank by the ECB, it was told to reduce gross non-performing loans from €46.9bn to €32.6bn by 2018, representing a cut of 30% over the next three years.
Investor concern over the strength of the industry has hit Italian banking shares this year.

===Input Doc/Src: The Ministry of the Defence (MoD) has had a tracking station on the isle since 1957.
It is linked to a missile range controlled from a military site on Benbecula in the Western Isles.
The National Trust for Scotland, which manages St Kilda along with the MoD, said the planned new buildings were "sympathetic and sustainable".
St Kilda lies about 40 miles (64km) west of North Uist, the nearest inhabited place to the archipelago.
The last islanders left St Kilda in 1930 and people only now live on Hirta on a temporary basis to work at the military site, or on wildlife conservation projects.
The MoD, working with its defence contractors QinetiQ and Skye-based architects Wittets, has submitted a planning application to Western Isles local authority, Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, for a redevelopment and environmental upgrading of its 50-year-old St Kilda facilities.
Galliford Try International and Hugh Broughton Architects have been appointed to develop the design of the new buildings.
NTS said the firms would be using expertise gained through building similar facilities in environments with challenging climates, including work for the British Antarctic Survey.
Lower parts of the new buildings would be "curtained" with stone walls designed to blend into the St Kildan landscape.
Wood panelling over the exterior walls will attain colours through weathering that will complement the surrounding scenery and roofs will be planted with native St Kildan grasses, said NTS.
Susan Bain, the trust's property manager for St Kilda, said: "We have been very impressed by the extent to which the MoD and its partners have gone to make sure they come up with proposals that will enhance the existing site and are both sympathetic and sustainable in the vitally important context of St Kilda.

===Input Doc/Src: But is it possible dragons could ever exist beyond the pages of Celtic mythology or the celluloid of fantasy film?
Academics have suggested in a recent essay the creation of large, winged dragons using cutting-edge genome editing is not beyond the realms of possibility.
Is the seemingly far-fetched idea a flier or, like dragon's breath, just hot air? The BBC asked the authors.
The essay in The American Journal of Bioethics said spectacular animals could be brought to life using a targeted gene-editing system known as CRISPR-CAS9.
Co-authors Prof Hank T Greely, director of the Centre for Law and the Biosciences at Stanford Law School, and Prof R Alta Charo, Professor of Bioethics and Law at Wisconsin Law School, said their dragon suggestion was "somewhat tongue-in-cheek" but "not impossible".
"There are the possibilities of spectacles," they wrote. "Animals and plants not created for personal use but to be exhibited.
"Consider, for example, the dragon. Basic physics will almost certainly combine with biological constraints to prevent the creation of flying or fire-breathing dragons.
"But a very large reptile that looks at least somewhat like the European or Asian dragon (perhaps with flappable if not flyable wings) could be someone's target of opportunity."
And it may not be as improbable as it seems at first blush.
CRISPR and other similar techniques involve DNA being inserted, replaced, or removed from a genome using artificially engineered nucleases.
The method has been adopted by scientists around the world.
CRISPRs (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) are sections of DNA, while CAS-9 (CRISPR-associated protein 9) is an enzyme.
They are found in bacteria, which use them to disable attacks from viruses.
They have led to the creation of patented "GloFish" that shine under UV light, the eradication of horns from certain cattle species, manipulation of crops and attempts to produce hypo-allergenic cats.

===Input Doc/Src: Cezary Sobiewski, 40, murdered Barbara Baraniecka weeks after she confided concerns about his drinking to friends.
A judge said Sobiewski went to buy cider after the "sustained and brutal attack" at the couple's home in Tipton, West Midlands.
Sobiewski admitted Ms Baraniecka's murder on Monday.
He entered the plea on what would have been the start of his trial at Wolverhampton Crown Court.
Updates on this and other stories in Birmingham and the Black Country
The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said Ms Baraniecka had told Sobiewski she wanted to end their relationship last October, a month before her death.
She had already confided in friends she had concerns about his increased alcohol consumption.
Police said Sobiewski, who had moved to the UK from the US in 2010 to live with Ms Baraniecka, was arrested at the scene.
Her 25-year-old daughter found her covered in blood on her bed as Sobiewski sat in the kitchen.
Paramedics confirmed she had been dead for several hours.
Sentencing him, Judge John Wait said: "Having killed Barbara Baraniecka in the course of a sustained and brutal attack, you went out to the supermarket, bought cider and sat at home drinking it, leaving Barbara's daughter to find her mother's body and call the emergency services.
"You took the life of someone who had many friends and who was the mother of two daughters."
Speaking after Sobiewski's guilty plea on Monday, Det Insp Jim Munro said: "I very much hope that now this case is over, it will in some small way allow Barbara's daughters to start rebuilding their lives after the terrible events of November last year."
"Cezary Sobiewski could not control his drinking or his jealousy and his actions have resulted in the death of a completely innocent woman."

===Input Doc/Src: Three separate experts say Tata made the cash by selling carbon emissions permits it was given for free.
They say Tata was allocated more carbon allowances under the EU emissions trading scheme (EUETS) than it needed.
There is no suggestion Tata broke the rules, and the firm said its permits were a "matter of public record".
Reports say Tata profited more than any other firm in the UK from the much-criticised trading scheme, which allowed it to sell the surplus to other firms wanting permits to pollute.
Other windfalls allegedly went to Lafarge, Hanson, and Total UK.
But the analysis is controversial because some climate sceptics blamed EU climate policies for the demise of Tata.
One report - by consultants CE Delft for citizens' group Carbon Market Watch - shows that the ailing steel firm was the UK's biggest beneficiary of the EUETS windfall, making £704m.
Overall it says industry across Europe has earned a £19bn windfall from 2008 to 2014.
Tata declined to comment on the specific figures, but said it disagreed with the methodology used in the reports for calculating its profits from the EUETS.
It said the allegations were a "selective telling of the many flaws in the EUETS."
A spokesman told BBC News: "We agree that the current emissions trading system needs to be fixed and all parties should focus on how best this can be done, rather than conducting theoretical studies on what it could have previously meant for individual companies."
The problem happened because when the EUETS began national governments were left to decide how many carbon permits their industries needed to cushion themselves from foreign competition.
The governments typically allocated more permits than necessary because it cost them nothing directly, whilst boosting domestic firms.
The sectors profiting most from pollution payouts have been iron and steel, cement, refineries and petrochemicals.
One report says the amount netted by industry over the period is more than 10 times the amount the EU

===Input Doc/Src: The 28 prefabricated homes will provide emergency housing for people who would otherwise be forced to stay in bed and breakfast accommodation.
Reading Borough Council said it had about 120 families staying in guest houses at the end of 2016.
Work begins in Lowfield Road on Tuesday with the first residents due to arrive in the autumn.
The development, on the site of a former mobile home park, will consist of seven timber-clad blocks of four units, two storeys high, a children's play area, car parking and bike sheds.
Each unit will have two bedrooms, a bathroom, kitchen-diner and a living room.
The 28 homes are intended to house homeless families while they are waiting for authority-owned or housing association accommodation to become available.
Legally councils can house families in temporary accommodation for a maximum of six weeks.
The council said the stock of affordable housing in Reading had reduced because of high land prices and rents, as well as right-to-buy sales.
Housing councillor Richard Davies said: "Reading, along with many other towns and cities in the region, has seen an increase in the number of families requiring emergency housing.
"This has resulted in the council being forced to use bed and breakfast accommodation which is unsuitable and disruptive for homeless families."

===Input Doc/Src: Under the rules, racegoers will also have to wear skirts or dresses of "modest length" falling just above the knee or longer.
For men, a waistcoat and tie will be compulsory in the enclosure and cravats will not be allowed.
Organisers said the decision was part of a move to restore formality.
The annual week-long event in June attracts about 300,000 visitors each year.
The popularity for elaborate fascinators, which are a cross between a hair accessory and a mini hat, continued last year after the Duchess of Cambridge wore a feathered one on her first official engagement in Anglesey.
In the less formal grandstand, which is open to the public, it will now be compulsory for women to wear a hat or fascinator.
In previous years, when female racegoers were simply advised that "many ladies wear hats".
Strapless or sheer-strap tops and dresses will also be banned.
For men, a suit and tie will now be obligatory.
Ascot spokesman Nick Smith said: "It is probably fair to say the dress code hasn't necessarily been enforced quite as rigorously as we might have liked.
"There is no doubt our customers would like to get back to a situation where it is universally acknowledged this is a formal occasion and not an occasion where you might dress as you would at a nightclub."
Charles Barnett, Ascot's chief executive, said the intention was to be "as helpful as possible" to visitors and to help racegoers in understanding what is "cherished" about the dress code at Royal Ascot.
"It isn't a question of elitism and not being modern in a world where there is less and less requirement to dress smartly - far from it," he said.
"We want to see modern and stylish dress at Royal Ascot, just within the parameters of formal wear."
The less formal Silver Ring will not be affected by the changes.
---Sum/Tgt: Women will have to wear hats, not fascinators, as part of a tightening of the dress code in Royal Ascot's Royal Enclosure this summer.

===Input Doc/Src: Louise Wright, from Mapperley, died after she was hit by a lorry in Nottingham city centre earlier this month.
A bike which has been painted white, known as a ghost bike, has been left at the scene along with floral tributes.
Her partner James Faulkner said he hoped it would promote cycle safety.
Ms Wright, who worked for fashion firm Paul Smith, died on 3 July after the crash involving an HGV in Lower Parliament Street.
The ghost bike, thought to be the first in the East Midlands, appeared recently along with tributes to the popular 29-year-old.
Mr Faulkner said he and Ms Wright's family had taken comfort from many well-wishers' kind words.
"We still don't know the circumstances of the accident yet, but I hope that the ghost bike will help raise awareness of cyclists on the roads," he said.
"If it can help prevent any future accidents, then it will have served a purpose and could help save a life."
Tributes were also paid to Ms Wright on Facebook, including by the Nottingham Roller Girls roller derby team who described her as beautiful, vibrant and funny.
Mike Hallam, duty manager at business Machine Mart next to the crash scene, said some people had reservations about the memorial.
"I dare say most people were touched but there were a few mixed reactions, whether it was tasteless or not," he said.
"Personally I think it was a very good idea."

===Input Doc/Src: As the victims struggle with the misery of damage, mud and ruin, officials say we have entered an era of "unknown extremes" of weather and they want a "complete rethink" of how flooding is handled.
Some aspects of the response are infinitely improved from earlier disasters. The emergency teams from organisations as diverse as the fire brigades, the RNLI and the police are far better co-ordinated than they used to be.
In Carlisle earlier this month, I saw one mountain rescue team, well-equipped with an inflatable boat, ropes, torches and radios, inch through deep water in total darkness to carefully and tenderly deliver a frightened woman to safety.
But however professional the response, questions are inevitably raised about why this effort is needed in the first place, with people demanding to know why their communities were not better defended.
And that leads to a sense of anger that as victims of flooding feel ignored or let down by the authorities for failing to keep them safe.
I first witnessed this during the summer of 2007 in Hull, where thousands of families were displaced by floods with some still in temporary housing a year later.
One family I interviewed were incensed at the prospect of facing a second Christmas in a chilly caravan.
Earlier this month, residents in Carlisle, who had watched the construction of a £38m flood-defence scheme just five years before, reacted with fury as it was overtopped by rising waters.
We have heard anger too from Leeds City Council which, like many northern authorities, believes that Whitehall favours the South when it comes to allocating funds for flood defence - though the government insists that the North does better on a per capita basis.
And anger has been voiced in York in the past few days as the Environment Agency made a fateful decision to lift the Foss Barrier, a key part of the city's flood defence system.

India said one woman was killed and three other civilians wounded in firing by Pakistani soldiers.
Pakistan's army also said it shot down an Indian spy drone in Kashmir.
Pakistan summoned the Indian ambassador on Thursday to hear a "strong protest over airspace violation", the AFP news agency quoting a statement issued by the Pakistani foreign ministry said.
The incidents come days after Mr Modi accepted an invitation from Mr Sharif to attend a regional summit in Islamabad next year, signalling a new thaw in a strained relationship. This will be Mr Modi's first visit to Pakistan after he took power last year.
India and Pakistan have often accused each other of unprovoked firing along the disputed border. A ceasefire agreed in 2003 remains in place, but the neighbours often accuse each other of violating it.
Pakistan's military said four civilians, including a 18-year-old girl, had died and five others were wounded when Indian troops fired across the de facto border in Sialkot region on Wednesday morning.
Across the border, Indian border guards said one woman had been killed and three other civilians injured when Pakistani soldiers fired shells which exploded near a border village in Pargwal area on Wednesday.
"It was a blatant, unprovoked cease-fire violation by Pakistan," D Parekh of India's Border Security Force told the Associated Press news agency.
Meanwhile, India's army and air force have denied that any of their drones had been shot down or crashed in Pakistan, reports said.

Skondras joined PAOK from Atromitos in 2013 and has made 94 appearances for the Thessaloniki-based club.
But he has not played at all this season after Vladimir Ivic took over as head coach.
Skondras is unlikely to receive international clearance in time to play for Hamilton in Tuesday's Scottish Premiership game against Inverness Caledonian Thistle.
The defender, who has played for PAOK in the Champions League and Europa League, becomes the second player to sign for a Scottish club on Monday after leaving PAOK.
Former team-mate Alexandros Tziolis, the Greece midfielder,  joined Hearts until the end of the season.
Accies player-manager Martin Canning is also on the look-out for a striker but says he may have to leave it late as Tuesday's 23:00 GMT transfer deadline looms.
"I'm still speaking to a couple of strikers that I'd like to get in, but they will be last minute things if they end up going through," he said.
However, he does not expect to be waving goodbye to top scorer Ali Crawford any time soon.
The midfielder has nine goals this season but missed a glorious chance to put Hamilton in front against St Johnstone on Saturday in a game Accies went on to lose 3-0 in Perth.
And his boss reckons he will need to start putting those kind of opportunities away if he wants to make a move to a bigger club.
"There has been literally no-one contacting the club about Ali," said Canning.
"I think his agent has asked how much we would accept for him, but that's the only question that has ever been put to us.
"Hopefully that opportunity will come for Ali, but he has got to keep his head down and continue to work hard and, if you look at Saturday's game, take the chances that will put him in the spotlight.

===Input Doc/Src: It emerged with the help of Iran during the Israeli occupation of Lebanon in the early 1980s, though its ideological roots stretch back to the Shia Islamic revival in Lebanon in the 1960s and '70s.
After Israel withdrew in 2000, Hezbollah resisted pressure to disarm and continued to strengthen its military wing, the Islamic Resistance. In some ways, its capabilities now exceed those of the Lebanese army, its considerable firepower used against Israel in the 2006 war.
The group also gradually became a key power broker in Lebanon's political system, and has effectively gained veto power in the cabinet.
Hezbollah has been accused of carrying out a string of bombings and plots against Jewish and Israeli targets and is designated a terrorist organisation by Western states, Israel, Gulf Arab countries and the Arab League.
Some Lebanese consider Hezbollah a threat to the country's stability, but it is enduringly popular within the Shia community.
Hezbollah's precise origins are difficult to pinpoint, but its precursors emerged following the Israeli invasion of South Lebanon in response to attacks by Palestinian militants in 1982, when Shia leaders favouring a militant response broke away from the leading Amal movement.
The new organisation, Islamic Amal, received considerable military and organisational support from Iran's Revolutionary Guards based in the Bekaa Valley, and emerged as the most prominent and effective of the Shia militias that would later form Hezbollah.
The groups launched attacks on the Israeli military and its ally, the South Lebanon Army (SLA), as well as foreign powers in Lebanon. They are believed to have been behind the bombings of the US embassy and US Marine barracks in 1983, which together left 258 Americans and 58 French servicemen dead, and led Western peacekeeping forces to withdraw.

===Input Doc/Src: Parts of Madeira Terraces, have been fenced off since summer after warnings the Victorian structure could collapse.
Council leader Warren Morgan revealed in a Facebook post the authority has applied for Â£50,000 from the government's coastal revival fund.
Homeless people had been sleeping under the arches.
Mr Morgan said: "It is the preliminary step of the restoration process and whilst it does not detail our plans, I hope that it shows that a process, however slow, is underway."
The concern with the structure surrounds the corrosion of steel beams embedded in concrete which supports the deck of the terraces.
It was announced in October that more fencing was to be installed after rough sleepers were discovered.
At the time, Mr Morgan said the site would be secured and staff would help people find safer accommodation.

===Input Doc/Src: Some of them might even take place on a special Saturday sitting of the Commons, (the first since the Falklands War) if the prime minister so decides.
In the event of a Remain vote, most of what is below will probably take place, although it may be that there is some kind of statement on the result on Monday.
If the week's scheduled business does go ahead, look out for preliminary skirmishing in the Lords over the Buses Bill and the Investigatory Powers Bill, and keep an eye on an interesting attempt by the members of the Public Accounts Committee to amend the Finance Bill - another example of the hot new Westminster trend for select committees to try to push their recommendations into law.
Here's my rundown of the week ahead:
MPs return from their referendum recess at 2.30pm - when the first business will be Defence questions. It is highly likely that this will be followed by one or more ministerial statements or urgent questions, and somewhere in the mix, the newest MP, Dr Rosena Allin-Khan, who defended Sadiq Kahn's Tooting constituency for Labour, will take her seat.
Then - if the powers that be stick to the published agenda, the Commons will move on to the detail of the Finance Bill - the measure which enacts the Budget.
This will be the first of two days of committee stage  - there are Labour amendments to give more favourable tax treatment for low emissions vehicles and to review the tax treatment of workers employed through intermediaries - agency staff.
The SNP's Roger Mullin has an amendment calling for a review of the remuneration of investment fund managers, aimed at ensuring no element of their pay can be taxed as a capital gain.
But the most interesting may be the cross-party amendment signed by, among others, the Public Accounts Committee Chair, Meg Hillier, on tax transparency for multinational companies. The amendment, which I'm told is the brainchild of Labour ex-minister Caroline Flint, comes out of the PAC's hearings on the Google tax affair and

Civil protection officials have said they expect the blazes to be under control soon, but warn that soaring temperatures are hampering efforts.
The week's highest temperatures in the area are expected to reach about 38C (100F) and, together with windy conditions, could reignite fires that have already been brought under control.
Wildfires are an annual menace in Portugal. More broke out there between 1993 and 2013 than in Spain, France, Italy or Greece, the European Environment Agency reported last year, despite the country's relatively small geographical size.
Given that, was this year's tragedy preventable? Could Portugal have done anything more to save lives and minimise the damage?

===Input Doc/Src: Alien: Covenant, which is out in the UK on Friday, is the sequel to Scott's 2012 Prometheus and stars Michael Fassbender and Katherine Winterston.
The Guardian said the "parasitic space alien has returned for this watchable if unoriginal sci-fi thriller".
But The Telegraph said the film was "grandiose" and "exhilarating".
"To want more Alien after this... would be to want to see something very odd indeed," Robbie Collin continued. "But Covenant leaves the mythos feeling riper and more vitalised than ever."
In The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw went on to say: "The vu has never been so deja: It's a greatest-hits compilation of the other Alien films' freaky moments.
"The paradox is that though you are intended to recognise these touches, you won't really be impressed unless you happen to be seeing them for the first time."
The Independent described it as a "mightily impressive piece of cinematic engineering".
"Every second here is tinged with dark foreboding, with the relentless tension that marked the 1979 original," the paper's Clarisse Loughrey said.
The Mirror was equally effusive, saying: "Scott's final theatrical flourish sends the franchise spinning out in a new direction. This is screamingly great cinema."
In the US, where the movie comes out on 19 May, Variety magazine was firmly on the fence, saying the film was "more of the same, which is both a relief to fans and a letdown to those hoping it might pave new ground".
Its reviewer Peter Debruge concluded: "As acts of creation go, Scott has made an Alien movie for that segment of the audience that has always rooted for the monster."
In the Hollywood Reporter, the verdict was considerably more enthusiastic, saying the film was "gripping through its full two hours and spiked with some real surprises".
"This beautifully made sci-fi thriller will immeasurably boost fan interest in the run of prequels which Scott has recently said will consist of at least two more films until the action catches up to the 1979 original," 
---Sum/Tgt: Ridley Scott's return to directing a film in the Alien franchise has received mixed reviews ahead of its UK and US release.

===Input Doc/Src: This is their first major operation in CAR since about 150 troops were deployed in recent weeks to Bangui, amid warnings of a genocide.
Around a quarter of CAR's 4.6 million population have fled their homes since conflict erupted in March 2013 between mainly Muslim and Christian militias.
The African Union and France have about 7,000 troops in the country.
They have been battling to curb the conflict, and the EU has pledged to send up to 1,000 troops and the United Nations (UN) about 12,000 troops.
French troops handed control of the airport in the capital, Bangui, to the EU force on Wednesday.
Bangui has seen some of the worst fighting, and AU troops escorted more than 1,200 Muslims out of the city on Sunday to protect them from the mainly Christian anti-balaka militia.
The EU force is under the command of a French officer, Maj-Gen Philippe Ponties, and is made up of French and Estonian troops.
Source: Index Mundi
Their deployment to the airport is intended to allow French troops to move elsewhere in the country.
UN officials and aid agencies have warned that hatred between Christians and Muslims could lead to a genocide and the partition of the country.
Few Muslims remain in Bangui, with most of them fleeing to the north or neighbouring states.
Christians form the majority in CAR, and the anti-balaka say they took up arms after coming under attack from the mainly Muslim Seleka rebels who seized power in March 2013.
Seleka leader Michel Djotodia was forced to step down in January, because of his failure to stem the violence.
He had been the CAR's first Muslim ruler. His supporters accuse troops loyal to the president he overthrew, Francois Bozize, of fuelling the conflict.
---Sum/Tgt: European Union (EU) troops have taken control of security at the Central African Republic's (CAR) main airport.

===Input Doc/Src: The Office for National Statistics said there were 3.5 million such households in the UK between April and June this year, about 17.1% of all households including a working age adult.
This was down from 3.7 million, or 17.9%, a year earlier.
The highest percentage of workless households was in north-east England.
Some 23% of households including a working age adult were workless in the region. The lowest was in south-east England, where 13% of households were in this category.
Workless households are defined as homes where no-one aged from 16 to 64 is in employment. This could be because they are looking for work, or they have chosen not to work, or they are unable to work.
People may choose not to work because of family commitments, early retirement or study. They may be unable to work because of sickness or disability.
The data shows that the number of workless households in the UK dropped by 182,000 over the year.
This means that 4.9 million people aged 16 to 64 lived in workless households. The ONS said this was the first time the figure had dropped below five million since 2008.
Some 14% of all children in the UK, or 1.6 million, were living in these households. About two-thirds of them were in single-parent households.
Children's charities - Barnardo's and The Children's Society - said they welcomed the fact that the number of children living in workless households was falling.
However, a move into work did not necessarily mean a move out of poverty, they argued.
They said it was imperative for the government to reduce childcare costs for families on low incomes.
The proportion of workless households was at its highest in 1996, when comparable records began, when it stood at 20.9% in the UK. This fell steadily to 17.3% in 2006 before rising to 19.2% in 2010. It has fallen relatively sharply in the past three years.
In 2013, there were 297,000 households in which no adult has ever worked, down 43,000 on the previous year. If student households are excluded, thi

===Input Doc/Src: An estimated 250 people made the journey from Wales to the holy city of Mecca, near where the incident happened on Thursday.
The Muslim Council of Wales (MCW) had difficultly contacting some groups from Cardiff, Newport and Swansea.
All have now confirmed they are safe.
MCW general secretary Saleem Kidwai said he had made contact with all group leaders from Wales, and all those on the pilgrimages have been accounted for.
The MCW's director of projects Mohammed Alamgir said he is now ensuring adequate support services are available to the returning parties through its network of chaplains and Imams.
"There was great concern for families and many members of the Welsh Muslim community waited anxiously for news of their loved ones and friends. Prayers were offered across Wales hoping for good news," he said on Sunday.
"We all now wait for the outcome of the investigation launched by the Saudi government and hope for further safeguards to ensure the safety of pilgrims."
Along with those killed, a further 863 people were injured in the incident at Mina, which happened as two million pilgrims were taking part in the Hajj's last major rite.

===Input Doc/Src: BT is paying the money to Deutsche Telekom and Orange to avoid legal action over the issue.
The two companies now hold stakes in BT as a consequence of the deal that saw them sell the EE mobile network to the UK company.
The charge led to BT's first-quarter profits falling 42% to £418m.
In January, BT wrote down the value of its Italian unit by £530m after it said it had uncovered years of "inappropriate behaviour".
It said it had found evidence of improper accounting practices, leading to "the overstatement of earnings in our Italian business over a number of years".
The Financial Reporting Council (FRC), the UK's accountancy watchdog, is investigating the auditing of BT's financial statements for the years 2015-17.

The midfielder agreed personal terms with the Canaries this week and, having passed his medical, he has penned a three-and-a-half-year deal.
"He can add goals to our midfield, which I think we need," said Norwich manager Paul Lambert.
"He'll get better as a player the higher the level he goes up. If he does that he'll be a great player for us."
Former England Under-21 international Howson, a product of the Leeds academy, has made almost 200 appearances since his debut in 2006, but his contract was due to expire in the summer.
He has featured 22 times for his home town club this season, although he has not played since picking up a knee injury in the 2-0 win over Millwall at the beginning of December.
Meanwhile, Lambert has outlined a back injury as the reason for terminating the season-long loan of Manchester United defender Ritchie de Laet five months early.
The 23-year-old Belgian has played seven times for the Canaries, but has not featured since the 2-0 Premier League loss to Tottenham on 27 December.

He said leaving his post had been a "very difficult decision".
Problems came to light at the trust when 18-year-old Connor Sparrowhawk drowned in a bath at a care facility.
An inquest found neglect contributed his death, at Slade House in Oxford, in 2013.
A report commissioned by NHS England, published in December 2015, discovered that only 272 of the 722 deaths in the trust over the previous four years were investigated.
The trust was issued a warning notice by the CQC following an inspection in January.
In a statement Mr Petter said: "The trust has recently undergone a significant amount of scrutiny in some service areas and, given the challenges it faces, I feel it is appropriate for me to allow new board leadership to take forward the improvements.

===Input Doc/Src: His inclusion in the England Lions squad for the January tour of South Africa is great news, coming on the back of what have perhaps been England's most difficult few weeks of the entire period.
Trott has fought very hard to get into this position. When he first left Australia with what were later clarified as anxiety issues, many thought that his England career was over.
When his first attempt at a comeback was aborted in April, I was told by someone close to the Warwickshire batsman that the next step would be a quiet return playing some club cricket in South Africa.
The right-hander will play in the country of his birth, but on merit after receiving recognition from the selectors as a result of a very strong second part of the summer that saw him accumulate 628 first-class runs and average 54.22 as Warwickshire reached the final of the One-Day Cup.
Because of his South African roots and the decision for Trott to only be on tour for one three-day warm-up match and two first-class four-day games against South Africa A, this trip should not hold many difficulties for him.
He will also have the help of Andy Flower, who was in charge of England in Australia and will be working with the Lions in South Africa.
The experience in Australia will have taught Flower how to spot any problems that Trott may encounter, while I am sure the Zimbabwean will make it absolutely clear that the player must report any concerns he has.
Having taken the incredibly difficult decision to go public with his problems on leaving Australia, Trott no longer has to operate in secret, or fear embarrassment. Similarly, Flower knows he can keep a close eye on Trott without the worry of over-imposing himself.
Through all of this, representing England again will be on Trott's mind. Since he last played international cricket, Alastair Cook's side have moved on, with younger players like Gary Ballance and Joe Root doing very well, but there is still room for the 33-year-old's experience, especially wit

===Input Doc/Src: The latest available figures show that during 2014 there were 16.5 suicides per 100,000 in Northern Ireland.
Scotland had the second highest rate, at 14.5, followed by 10.3 in England and 9.2 in Wales.
It is the second consecutive year that Northern Ireland has recorded the UK's highest suicide rate.
However, the overall number of suicides in Northern Ireland decreased in 2014, falling to 268 compared to 303 deaths.
This reflected a small decrease in the total number of suicides across the UK as a whole in 2014, where the overall figure fell by 2%.
Last month, the Irish News reported that since the Good Friday Agreement was signed in 1998, more people have taken their own lives in Northern Ireland than were killed during the Troubles.
Prof Siobhan O'Neill, from Ulster University' Psychology Research Institute, told the BBC there may be a link between those decades of conflict and the deaths of some of those who have taken their lives in a time of relative peace.
"Deprivation certainly is one of the legacy issues and we know that those areas that are deprived, that have high levels of deprivation, have also been the same areas that were exposed to conflict.
"Those are the areas where our suicide rates are highest," she added.
That link between deprivation and despair means that the legacy of the Troubles is having an impact on another generation in places like Londonderry.
Emma Johnston works with the charity Youth Action Northern Ireland which tries to get young people to talk about their mental health. One of the locations where she tries to help them is the job centre.
"Every programme that we deliver, at its core, at its very essence, is focusing around young people's mental health and while we may not frame it to begin with in that way, it's about raising them up, making them more resilient and maybe trying to raise their optimism for their future," she said.

===Input Doc/Src: The interim New Democracy leader, 61, represents the old way - serving for years in centre-right governments accused by the left of bringing painful austerity and institutionalised corruption.
But after months of political strain, exhaustive bailout negotiations and continued economic despair, Greece is seemingly starting to regret its flirtation with the new.
According to latest opinion polls, Mr Meimarakis is now challenging Alexis Tsipras, Greece's youngest prime minister in modern times, for first place in this month's elections.
Commentators say he is a voice of economic stability, who has successfully unified his party to make a comeback.
Born in Athens in 1953, Vangelis Meimarakis's family were from Crete and his father was an MP in the island's main city Heraklion.
He trained as a lawyer at the University of Athens, and became involved in student politics while studying public administration at Panteion University.
He was one of the founding members New Democracy's youth wing (ONNED).
First elected as an MP in 1989, he was ND's chief whip from 1991 to 1992 and served as defence minister from 2006 to 2009.
He is married to Joanna Kolokota, daughter of Greek actress Nitsa Marouda, and they have two daughters.
Mr Meimarakis became speaker of the Greek parliament in 2012, briefly standing down that year amid a corruption scandal involving an inquiry into money laundering allegation.
He strongly denied any wrongdoing and returned to his position soon after, remaining as speaker until early 2015.
A strong supporter of keeping Greece in the eurozone, Mr Meimarakis was appointed interim leader of New Democracy in July 2015 after the resignation of Antonis Samaras.
Mr Samaras stepped down after voters backed Mr Tsipras in a bailout referendum by a bigger-than-expected margin.

But a few months later, its fortunes seem to

He is suspected to be second-in-command in the Jalisco New Generation cartel, led by his father Nemesio.
The gang is blamed for killing at least 20 police officers in March-April and May's shooting down of an army helicopter in which 10 people died.
Mr Oseguera Gonzalez, known as El Menchito, was arrested in Zapopan, near Guadalajara, the authorities said. No shots were fired.
This is the second time that he has been captured.
He was arrested in January 2014, but was released later that year for lack of evidence.
Mr Oseguera Gonzalez is suspected of controlling the cartel's finances and of buying drugs from South American countries.
The Jalisco New Generation cartel is involved in large-scale drug trafficking along Mexico's Pacific Coast.
It has recently increased its presence in the area, with Jalisco and the neighbouring Michoacan among Mexico's most violent states.
The Jalisco New Generation is also engaged in a turf war with the Knights Templar cartel.
Tens of thousands of people have been killed in drug-related violence in Mexico over the past eight years.
---Sum/Tgt: The Mexican authorities say they have arrested the son of one of the country's most wanted drug lords.

===Input Doc/Src: Costel Pantilimon could return from an ankle problem, and Daryl Janmaat's groin injury will also be assessed.
Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster is expected to start after overcoming a minor thigh issue picked up in the EFL Cup final last Sunday.
Defender Martin Caceres awaits his Saints debut, while Virgil van Dijk is still sidelined with an ankle injury.
Steve Wilson: "This is the only Premier League game Southampton will play between 11 February and 19 March, so Claude Puel will be especially keen to see a points return from Vicarage Road. The Frenchman will also feel that he is due a slice of luck after Wembley.
"Walter Mazzarri's Watford look destined for another creditable mid-table finish, but that's unlikely to earn the Italian an invitation to stay a second season.
"Mazzarri is the eighth manager employed by the Pozzo family since their ownership of the club began in 2012, and has been wise enough not to invest too much time in learning English.
"A pat on the back and a pay-off is probably what Mazzarri expects in the summer. That is unless Watford should slump between now and May - in which case he can forget the pat on the back."
Twitter:@Wilsonfooty
Watford head coach Walter Mazzarri: "For sure Southampton played a great game [in the EFL Cup final] and maybe they are a bit disappointed because they could have gone at least to extra time, or even won the cup.
"We will see on Saturday if they will react or not, but nobody can know this.
"We got confirmation that they are a very well-organised team and a very strong team."
Southampton manager Claude Puel on his side's fixture schedule: "My biggest job now is to prepare the team for the difficulty of the calendar.

===Input Doc/Src: The group wants to hold the events on 4 March in Locharbriggs - where it is based - and nearby Dumfries.
Dumfries and Galloway Council's licensing panel is being asked to issue permission for both events.
However, a parish priest in Dumfries has objected to the march saying it has "no reason whatsoever, historical or otherwise" to be held in the town.
The council has to be consulted by anyone wishing to hold any public procession.
The Locharbriggs Loyal Orange Lodge wants to stage one march through Dumfries at 15:30 on Saturday 4 March lasting for about 45 minutes.
It would follow a route along New Abbey Road, Laurieknowe, Galloway Street, Buccleuch Street, High Street, Shakespeare Street and Nith Place before ending at the Dock Park.
The second procession - starting at 18:00 - would take place for about half an hour through Locharbriggs.
It has been estimated that 75 people would take part in the Dumfries procession and 50 people in the Locharbriggs one.
Fr Jim Hayes of St Teresa's RC church has made a representation against the marches.
He said he was "dismayed" to see a procession being brought into the "heart of Dumfries".
He said he hoped marches of this kind by "any group of any persuasion" would "disappear from Scottish life altogether".

The carefully considered on-air interviews with Gerry Adams and Raymond McCartney on the distressing case of Mr McGahon were undermined by a tweet from Francie Molloy.
The Mid Ulster MP described the Spotlight programme as "another load of rubbish".
Mr Molloy's subsequent apology and deletion of his tweet doesn't expunge the impression that many republicans would prefer it if victims like Paudie McGahon and Mairia Cahill had obeyed the IRA's initial orders by  maintaining their silence.
Expect more discussion about the development of some kind of north-south process to examine the cover-up of abuse during the Troubles and the movement of abusers across the border or across the Irish Sea.
Fianna Fail's Micheál Martin wants "a cross-border mechanism to at least facilitate other victims to come forward, who might not want to go public".
Rather than being the party in the dock, Sinn Féin has tried to seize the initiative by advocating an "all-island process to deal with the issue of providing support mechanisms for all those who were victims of sexual abuse during the conflict".
Micheál Martin is dismissive of the Sinn Féin suggestion, arguing in the Dáil (Irish parliament) that it had been developed by republicans "just to dilute your culpability".
Northern Ireland's Justice Minister David Ford and his Irish counterpart Frances Fitzgerald are wary of sanctioning any process that might cut across investigations or reviews already under way involving the Garda (Irish police), the Police Ombudsman or the former DPP, Keir Starmer.
Mr Kenny is prepared to work with the first and deputy first ministers to consider a process related to the cross-border abuse allegations, however he emphasises that such a process "has to be independent of the court proceedings".

===Input Doc/Src: The team tracked the health of nearly 800 villagers from the Chianti region of Italy to see if their local tipple had any discernable impact.
They found no proof that the wine ingredient resveratrol stops heart disease or prolongs life.
Experts say more research is needed to get a definitive answer.
The British Heart Foundation is carrying out its own resveratrol study.
Many studies have sought to explain why there is a low incidence of heart disease in France, despite many of its inhabitants eating a high-fat diet.
Some put it down to moderate drinking of red wine.
Studies have shown that consumption of red wine, dark chocolate and berries reduces inflammation, leading researchers to speculate that their common ingredient, resveratrol, explains why.
But Prof Richard Semba, of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and colleagues found no evidence for this.
They chose two small towns in Tuscany as their test ground, and 783 elderly people who were living there agreed to take part in their investigation.
The volunteers gave details about their daily diets as well as urine samples for measurement of their resveratrol intake.
During the nine years of the study, 268 of the men and women died, 174 developed heart disease and 34 got cancer.
But urinary resveratrol was not linked with death risk, heart disease risk or cancer risk.
Nor was it associated with any markers of inflammation in the blood, the researchers report in JAMA Internal Medicine.
Prof Semba said: "The thinking was that certain foods are good for you because they contain resveratrol. We didn't find that at all.
"The story of resveratrol turns out to be another case where you get a lot of hype about health benefits that doesn't stand the test of time."
He says any benefits of drinking wine or eating dark chocolate or berries, if they are there, must come from other shared ingredients. And it's not clear how much you might need to eat or drink.

But a total of 32% in Wales said they had no religion, the highest total was in Blaenau Gwent with 41.1%; the lowest in Flintshire with 25.4%.
The Church in Wales said Christianity is "no longer the default setting" for many people but the picture is complex.
A quarter of the population in Wales and England as a whole said they have no religion.
This was a rise of 10% from 15% (7.7 million) in 2001 to 14.1 million in 2011.
Census: Key Welsh data on religion
But the proportion in Wales with no religion was higher than across Wales and England as a whole.
Those stating that they were Muslim in Wales is 1.5% - up from 0.7% - with the highest proportion in Cardiff (6.8%) and Newport (4.7%).
There were also slight increases in the percentage of people who said they were Hindu or Buddhist - both up from 0.2% to 0.3%.
There was also a rise in people saying they had other faiths - from 0.2% to 0.4%
The percentage who said they were Sikh or Jewish remained unchanged between 2001 and 2011 at 0.1%.
The Church in Wales said the figures show that Christianity "is no longer the default setting it once was for many people in Wales".
But a spokeswoman added that the reasons were complex.
"Today we find people go to church because they want to, not because they feel they have to or because it's the place to see and be seen," she said.
"It should also be borne in mind that statistics can't show the whole picture in matters of faith.
"The past few months, for example, have seen people in different parts of Wales turn to churches in their thousands following various tragic events: in Machynlleth, in Ely, in St Asaph.

===Input Doc/Src: However, only a fraction of those affected may receive compensation.
Legal filings indicated that 250,000 people had lost some Â£130m in benefits.
The Court of Appeal suggested the Department for Work and Pensions would owe a mere 1% of that amount, Â£1.3m, to just 2,500 people.
The complex judgment on Friday was originally prompted by a challenge from Cait Reilly, a geology graduate from Birmingham.
She had argued that requiring her to work at Poundland for no pay constituted a breach of her human rights.
The government - to counter such claims - had retrospectively altered the law to validate the docking of benefits.
Today, the Court of Appeal ruled that even under that new revised law, the docking of benefits could be incompatible with the European Convention of Human Rights.
The Court's ruling represented a defeat for the government.
Padraig Hughes, of Public Interest Lawyers, the group that brought Ms Reilly's case, said: "It is yet a further example of the reckless approach this Government continues to take towards the constitution and the rule of law."
The Court of Appeal judges did nevertheless acknowledge that government ministers can change laws to affect cases retrospectively.
And the judges decided that the only rights infringed upon where those of people that had already claimed the benefits docking was unfair.
This narrowing of the claimants explains why only a tiny fraction of people will be eligible for a payout.
"We are considering the judgment", a DWP spokesman said. "It is only right that jobseekers do all they can to find work while claiming benefits."
It is not clear yet whether either side will make a further appeal.
---Sum/Tgt: The government has lost the latest round of an extended legal battle involving the docking of benefits for jobseekers who refused to participate in unpaid back-to-work schemes.

===Input Doc/Src: That is how Mohammad Mallak, editor-in-chief of Syrian magazine Saiedet Souria, describes his colleague Naji Jerf.
"He was a smiling man, energetic. He was laughing all the timeâ€¦"
Last month, Jerf, a 38-year-old Syrian anti-Islamic State (IS) activist and journalist, was shot in broad daylight with a silenced pistol in the middle of a busy Turkish street. He was murdered in Gaziantep, a city near the Syrian border, now home to nearly 300,000 Syrians.
He was about to leave Turkey with his family for France, where he had been granted asylum. Soon after his death, Reporters Without Borders released the visa application letter Jerf wrote to the French ambassador in Turkey.
"I now live in the Turkish city of Gaziantep and my safety is more and more difficult after an increase in the threats to me and my family - above all because I am a secularist and belong to the Ismaili minority, which is targeted by the jihadis."
Jerf's journalism and activism made him a target in Syria, the reason he fled across the border to Turkey in November 2012. "Naji was one of the first people who was trying to document what is happening in Syria," says Mohammad Mallak. "The regime wanted him."
"At 2012 we began to see that our friends were being taken and got killed by the regime," he adds. "We knew that if they took a friend that they would call the family in two days to deliver his dead body."
Once in Turkey, Jerf made two anti-IS films. One of them, about IS in Aleppo, was broadcast on the Saudi-run al-Arabiya channel in September 2012, to an audience of at least 12m, according to the channel.
Mr Mallak says that after the release of this documentary, the threats against Jerf, who had two young daughters, increased.
"He was afraid. He knew that they were planning to do that. But he didn't believe they could do it. Still, he was saying that he knew that they would shoot him. One day he said, 'But I am afraid of the sound of shooting.'"

===Input Doc/Src: Addicks supporters have staged a series of protests aimed at the Belgian businessman in recent months, prompting a statement claiming some fans "want the club to fail".
"Whether you like protests or not, the fans feel they need to be heard," Powell told BBC Radio London.
"They want answers and, quite clearly, they are not getting them."
Some Charlton fans have formed a campaigning group called CARD (Coalition Against Roland Duchatelet) which is calling for the the Belgian to sell the club.
Several protests took place at their last home match against Middlesbrough including a mock funeral, beach balls being thrown onto the pitch to halt the game and a walk-out by supporters in the second half.
Last month Duchatelet, who has a network of clubs around Europe, told the South London Press he has "empathy" for the fans, but was not prepared to sell.
Powell had three stints as a player at The Valley and was manager when Duchatelet took over the club in January 2014 - only to be dismissed in March that year.
"They made the statement last week which I don't think any supporter could understand," Powell, 46, added.
"It quite clearly shows there is no synergy between the owners, the higher management and the fans.
"I don't know what will happen. I'm sure many thousands of Charlton fans would like that question to be answered.

The 29-year-old, from Alva in Clackmannanshire, had been the bookies' favourite to win the final.
After his victory was announced, Stevie said: "I never thought this was possible."
His debut single - a cover of Lost Stars - has already been released.
He has also been asked to perform at this year's T in the Park.
The firefighter only ended up on the show after his workmates entered him.
Asked what colleagues at his fire station would think, he said: "I think they're over the moon for me because they all wanted me to go for it.

A spokesman for bookmakers Coral said: "Stevie has proved a popular winner in this year's series of The Voice as he was well backed to win the show ever since his blind audition.
"All three previous winners of The Voice have struggled in the charts but our odds suggest Stevie could have some success with his debut single and album."

Di Resta will combine F1 duties with racing for Mercedes in Germany's DTM touring car series.
He said he was "delighted" to stay at Williams and "looking forward to understanding the new regulations" introduced to F1 this season in an attempt to make the cars faster, more dramatic and more appealing to the audience.

Di Resta's best race results in F1 have been two fourth places in Singapore in 2012 and Bahrain in 2013. He was the DTM champion for Mercedes in 2010.
Part of his responsibilities at Williams will involve helping Brazilian veteran Massa, 35, support Stroll, an 18-year-old Canadian rookie who brings financial backing reported to be at least £20m to the team.

Mr Hartnett, who left HMRC in 2012, was giving evidence to the Commons Public Accounts Committee.
HSBC has come under fire over what it knew about some clients' tax affairs.
Details of some 30,000 accounts at HSBC's Geneva-based private bank were leaked to the French authorities by a whistleblower, Herve Falciani, in 2007.
Information about 3,600 UK account holders were passed to HMRC.
Both HSBC and HMRC have been accused of not doing enough to investigate if these accounts were held for the purposes of tax evasion rather than legitimate avoidance.
Mr Hartnett told the committee: "I'd like to understand why there weren't more criminal prosecutions. I'd always expected there to be more. I'd have liked to understand what would have happened if  more resources were diverted to [investigating the leaked details]."
He said there were discussions with the French authorities before the leaked information was passed to the UK, and there were also discussions with HSBC. But he never got involved in the detail, "to pressure the integrity of the investigations taking place".
But HMRC tax assurance commissioner Edward Troup insisted that his department had been "diligent" in pursuing the information received from the French.
"I don't think there is anything... which suggests that we have not been diligent," he told the committee. "We have collected Â£135m. We believe we have collected all the tax, all the interest, and a significant amount of penalties."
Mr Hartnett now works for HSBC. He said that he had followed the rules for former senior officials on taking appointments outside the civil service "to the letter".
He said: "Colleagues checked it, the Cabinet Office checked it, the committee checked it, it went to the Prime Minister, and the Financial Conduct Authority also had to approve my appointment."

Eric was originally built in 1928 by Captain WH Richards and AH Reffell.
However, after he amazed crowds all over the world, Eric mysteriously disappeared - never to be seen again.
That is until 2016, when the Science Museum launched a campaign to raise money to build a copy of Eric.
Artist and robot builder Giles Walker agreed to help build the new and improved Eric.
However, the only information he had to go off were old newspaper stories, a short video from the 1920s, and a scribbled copy of the original building plans.
Instead of his old gears and pulleys, Eric is now operated by wires and motors.
It took Giles five months to build the new robot and he stands at a whopping two metres tall.
He is made from aluminium and can move his arms and head, and speak a number of phrases.

Stills from a night vision camera set up to track wildcats clearly show the nocturnal mammal standing on its hind legs and eating bait.
The public have been warned not to approach the raccoon as it could bite.
Stan Whitaker, SNH Wildlife and Non-Native Species Manager,  said: "Raccoons could cause millions of pounds worth of damage per year to the Scottish economy if they became established here.
"They could also cause significant damage to our native wildlife by preying on birds, small animals and amphibians.
"Raccoons aren't dangerous, but they may give you a nasty bite if cornered. The raccoon that has been recorded is an adult and roughly the size of a domestic cat."
He added: "Ideally, we would like to trap this raccoon and rehome it in a zoo or wildlife park.
"If you come across the raccoon, do not approach it, but please report it immediately to Scotland's Environmental and Rural Services."
Raccoons are listed as one of the top 50 invasive, non-native species in Scotland. Kept as pets and in zoos, there have been several escapes in the last few years.
They are considered a nuisance in their native north America,  as they damage buildings and gardens and forage in rubbish bins. They also carry wildlife diseases such as rabies.

===Input Doc/Src: Fed up with the way British Airways was handling the issue of his father's lost luggage, businessman Hasan Syed decided to complain about it.
But rather than just put out a normal tweet, he paid to have one promoted.
Using promoted tweets in this way could represent a new trend, experts believe.
The promoted tweet bought by Mr Syed reads: "Don't fly @BritishAirways. Their customer service is horrendous."
Promoted tweets are generally bought by advertisers who want to reach a wider audience. The paid-for tweet is given high prominence in the Twitter feed of the relevant company but otherwise acts as a normal message and can be retweeted by others.
Mr Syed purchased his paid-for tweet via Twitter's self-service ad platform for an undisclosed sum. He targeted New York and UK markets with the tweet.
The decision to highlight BA's customer service came following a trip his parents made from Chicago to Paris at the weekend, during which his father lost his luggage.
Six hours after the tweet went live, and was picked up by news website Mashable, it had been read by thousands of Twitter users, retweeted and commented on.
But it took another four hours for British Airways to pick up on it: "Sorry for the delay in responding, our twitter feed is open 09:00-17:00 GMT. Please DM [direct message] your baggage ref and we'll look into this."
The idea that the ad platform of large corporations can be hijacked by members of the public is an interesting trend, thinks Shashank Nigam, chief executive of aviation consultancy SimpliFlying.
"The implications are tremendous for the future of airline customer service, especially on social media," he said in his blog.
"These tools are easy to use and brand detractors have the same access to them as corporations. I'd guess that this cost less than a thousand dollars to buy and Mr Syed targeted it smartly," Mr Nigam told the BBC.

"Having now worked together for a season, we know where we need to improve with the obvious goal, to go on now and challenge for the Superbike wins at all of the big three internationals," said Hutchinson.
"The BMW S1000RR still has so much potential in Superbike trim on the roads and with another season of British Superstock planned, the aim there will be to go one step better and win the championship next season."
"Hutchy did a great job for us this season and whether it was in British championship or the roads, he was always in contentions for wins and podiums and provided both our sponsors and fans with a lot of entertainment," added team owner Hector Neill.
"His international hat-trick in the Superstock class and his terrific season in British Superstock proved how well he got on with the Tyco BMW, and to go on and take the world's fastest track lap record at Dundrod was the icing on the cake.
"The goal going forward is to build on that success and I've never hidden the fact that the Senior TT trophy is the one we really want to win in 2017.
It's the blue-riband road race on the season's calendar, and along with Hutchy and our dedicated team we will be gi

===Input Doc/Src: The Scottish Gamekeepers' Association said the latest employment figures showed the sector was outperforming other areas of the economy.
North Highland College in Thurso reported that every one of this year's Higher National Certificate students has secured a job on a sporting estate.
Country sports are thought to be worth Â£240m a year to the Scottish economy.
The gamekeeping and wildlife management course was designed to provide students with training in conservation as well as traditional gamekeeping skills, including snaring and the use of firearms.
North Highland College gamekeeping lecturer Richard MacNicol said: "The modern gamekeeper has to have a rounded, balanced approach to land management.
"Our graduates are helping to support the rural economy and a diverse, well managed countryside."
Borders College and Scotland's Rural University College in Fife also said the skills obtained by their students were proving valuable to landowners.
The Scottish Gamekeepers' Association has welcomed the news.
SGA chairman Alex Hogg said: "This is a major success story and the three colleges deserve immense credit.
"We are creating youth jobs at a time when the economy is faltering and young people, especially in remote areas, have few other opportunities."
There is real frustration amongst landowners and the gamekeepers they employ about the profession's image.
Political and media attention often focuses on cases of wildlife crime, most notably the illegal persecution of birds of prey.
Gamekeepers believe they do not get the credit they deserve for the stewardship of our countryside, while landowners argue the economic benefit of country sports is often overlooked.
They are hoping the new generation of gamekeepers being trained by Scotland's colleges will help change that.
Angus McNicol, of Cawdor Estates near Nairn, told BBC Scotland: "It's a highly-trained profession these days. It's very different to how things were in the past."
---Sum/Tgt: Colleges across Scotland are reporting strong demand from sporting estates for newly-trained gamekeepers.

===Input Doc/Src: The first minister will say Wales needs two Labour governments to ensure the economy works "for everyone".
The party says it will deliver tidal lagoons, rail electrification and the Wylfa Newydd Nuclear Plant.
It will also create a Development Bank of Wales, if in power in Cardiff and London.
The party says it will ensure the level of funding Wales currently receives from the European Union continues beyond Brexit.
Welsh Labour has so far been attempting to run a largely separate election campaign, fronted by First Minister Carwyn Jones rather than UK leader Jeremy Corbyn.
At a launch for the campaign in Cardiff two weeks ago, Mr Jones made no reference to Mr Corbyn, and three of the five pledges unveiled related to the work of the Labour-run Welsh Government in Cardiff Bay, rather than issues under Westminster control.
Speaking at the launch in the Delyn constituency in north Wales later today, Mr Jones will say: "Our manifesto is an ambitious, comprehensive plan of what Welsh Labour can do, together, working in the assembly and Westminster."
He will add: "Working in partnership, Welsh Labour will commit to protecting the funding that would have come to Wales through the EU.
"That money will be spent in Wales, and on Welsh priorities, and not stashed away in Whitehall as the Tories now threaten."
The first minister will say a Labour government at Westminster would ensure an "estimated Â£1.5bn extra" will come to Wales every year.
The general election manifesto says Welsh Labour will also work with a UK Labour government to abolish the Severn bridges tolls and hand over responsibility for policing from Whitehall to the Welsh Assembly.
---Sum/Tgt: Welsh Labour is promising a "real partnership" with a Labour government in Westminster as it launches its manifesto on Monday.

===Input Doc/Src: The Death of Poor Joe, which dates back to March 1901, was discovered by British Film Institute (BFI) curator Bryony Dixon, in February.
Until now the earliest known Dickens film was Scrooge or Marley's Ghost, released in November 1901.
"It's wonderful to have discovered such a rare and unique film," Ms Dixon said.
"It looks beautiful and is in excellent condition. This really is the icing on the cake of our current celebration of Dickens on Screen."
The Death of Poor Joe will be screened as part of the Dickens bicentennial celebrations on 9 March and 23 March at London's BFI Southbank.
The film organisation said it is also planning to release the footage on a DVD at a later date.
Accidental find
Ms Dixon stumbled across the find as she carried out research on early films of China.
A catalogue entry referred to The Death of Poor Joe, which she recognised as a reference to the character Jo in Bleak House.
After checking on the BFI's archive database, she found the film was listed as part of a collection under an alternative title of Man Meets Ragged Boy, which had been wrongly dated 1902.
The film, which is just one minute long, depicts Joe dying in the freezing snow against a churchyard wall.
As he falls to the ground a local watchman tries to help him and cradles him as he dies.
The footage, which was directed by film pioneer George Albert Smith, was handed to the BFI in 1954, by a collector in Brighton who had known Smith.
The BFI said it believes the director's wife, Laura Bayley, played Joe and the character of the watchman was played by Tom Green. The footage is believed to have been shot in Brighton.
The BFI said the storyline has similarities with Hans Christian Andersen's The Little Match Girl, which features a child dying in the snow and the tragic death of 'Poor Joe', the crossing sweeper in Dickens' Bleak House.
---Sum/Tgt: The oldest surviving film featuring a Charles Dickens character has been discovered, in the year of the 200th anniversary of the author's birth.

===Input Doc/Src: Teams are set to be composed of big-name players and sevens specialists.
New Zealand's Sonny Bill Williams is already playing full-time sevens but British clubs seem unlikely to release players until shortly before the Games.
"It is a very condensed programme and that puts us up against it," said Amor.
"The door is open for players from the 15-a-side game to put their hand up but the guys playing on the Sevens World Series, tournament in and tournament out, are in the driving seat."
In addition to 2015 Rugby World Cup-winner Williams, global names such as South Africa's Bryan Habana and Australia's Quade Cooper are keen on Olympic spots, while Wales wing George North and England back Danny Cipriani are among the home nations stars to have expressed an interest.
However, many of the players on show in Rio are likely to be sevens specialists who only play the abbreviated form of the game and have competed in the Sevens World Series for some time already,
England, Wales and Scotland compete separately on the Sevens World Series, but will come together to form a team for the Olympics.
And Amor hopes to hear before the end of the year if an application to field a Great Britain team at the second-tier Grand Prix Sevens series in summer 2016 will be approved.
The Grand Prix series consisted of three events last year and the 2016 finale will take place at Exeter's Sandy Park on 9-10 July - a month before the Olympic sevens tournament takes place.
While World Rugby's regulations state that players must be free to play in the Olympics themselves, clubs are under no such obligations to release their stars for the Sevens World Series, which begins on Friday in Dubai.
English side Wasps said in August that they would only allow players such as winger Christian Wade to join up with Great Britain two weeks before the start of the Olympics, in line with Premiership Rugby policy.
"We are working to see if there is a way of accessing players at the right time that works for both them

He went on the run after failing to return to prison in 2012, but later gave himself up. He also absconded from open prison in 2001.
Members of the public are being advised not to approach Frater, who "could present a risk to the public".
Det Supt Jez Noyce, of Dorset Police, said: "There may be various reasons why he has not complied with his release from prison licence conditions and I appeal to him directly to make contact with police at the earliest opportunity.
"I'd like to assure members of the public that officers are making every effort to find this man as soon as possible".

MSPs and the police watchdog are looking into transparency at the SPA.
Current board members defended Mr Flanagan, saying there was a "changing atmosphere".
The public audit committee has held a series of sessions on transparency at the authority, with one MSP, Alex Neil, decrying an apparent "secret society" within the board. He previously told Mr Flanagan that "it's not the Kremlin you're running".
In the latest session, witnesses included Derek Penman, HM chief inspector of constabulary in Scotland, Ms Ali, and a group of current board members.
Ms Ali left the board amid a row with Mr Flanagan over whether meetings should be held behind closed doors.
She said Mr Flanagan had told her that expressing disagreement publicly was a resignation matter, and told MSPs that her "removal from the board was straightforward punishment for speaking out".
She said it had been a "really horrendous experience", and said she did not believe it would have happened to her if she was a man.
Asked by Labour MSP Monica Lennon if she felt Mr Flanagan was fit to continue as chairman of the SPA board, she replied: "He's not fit to continue on any public board."
However, board members defended Mr Flanagan and the authority, with Iain Whyte characterising it as "an improving board and an improving organisation".
And George Graham said he didn't recognise the characterisation of the board presented, saying "we are listening and we are ready to adapt our approach".
He said there was a "changing atmosphere" at the SPA since Mr Flanagan took over, saying the board was "much more engaged" with "a clearer sense of purpose".

===Input Doc/Src: The assault had earlier been thought to have been a spontaneous reaction to protests over an anti-Islamic film.
US President Barack Obama has called the presidents of Egypt and Libya to urge cooperation over security for diplomatic staff.
There have been further clashes outside the US embassy in Cairo overnight.
Thousands of people gathered outside the building in the Egyptian capital, chanting and starting fires.
Police and troops fired tear gas to break up the crowds, some of whom were seen carrying petrol bombs.
On Wednesday, demonstrators in Cairo angry at the film - Innocence of Muslims - had breached the walls of the US embassy and torn down the flag.
President Barack Obama has vowed to bring those behind the attack to justice, but said the US would not "break bonds" with the new Libyan government.
The White House says Mr Obama spoke to Libyan President Mohamed Magarief on Wednesday evening and agreed the two countries should work together to identify the attackers.
In a further call to Egypt, President Mohammed Morsi promised to ensure the safety of American staff in the country, the White House said.
Security has been tightened at US embassies across the world.
A marine anti-terrorism team is being deployed to Libya to bolster security there, a US defence source told reporters in Washington.

===Input Doc/Src: The Taliban have come close to the city in recent fighting, leaving it cut off and displacing tens of thousands.
A BBC correspondent who has flown into Kunduz has heard gunfire and artillery exchanges not far from its centre.
Afghan officials say foreign jihadists trained by the Islamic State (IS) group are fighting alongside the Taliban.
Provincial governor Mohammed Omer Safi told the BBC that the bodies of 18 foreign fighters, including three Chechen women, had been found.
Security forces and Taliban have been involved in a stand-off for about a week after the insurgents launched an offensive on Kunduz at the end of April.
The insurgents are currently said to be massed in the Gul Tepa district on the southern outskirts of the city.
This is the first positive confirmation by a senior government official that Islamic State is operating alongside the Taliban in Afghanistan.
Until now, particularly in the south of the country, IS fighters have often clashed with the Taliban. But the governor said that the battle for the north is different, and here IS fighters are "supporting the Taliban, training the Taliban, trying to build the capacity of the Taliban for a bigger fight".
And, he said, they were more violent because they wanted to die in battle as martyrs.
As well as from Afghanistan's immediate northern neighbours, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan, the dead came from Chechnya and Turkey. They were wearing black headbands marked with the same Islamic verses used by IS in Syria and Iraq.
Battle heralds militant tie-up
Correspondents say the advance is the most serious threat to a provincial capital in years.
Afghan army and police are involved in the fighting but there is no substantial help from foreign troops.
The BBC's David Loyn in Kunduz says Afghan forces are thinly spread in this region, and as well as this determined assault on Kunduz the Taliban and their allies have also attacked remote outposts in the mountains of Badakhshan further east.

Labour and Plaid had a "little Britain mentality" when a "globally facing Britain" was needed, Mr Davies wrote.
He made the comments in an article for The Times newspaper's website.
On Thursday, Welsh Government economic advisor Kevin Gardiner said some people were "perhaps unduly pessimistic" after the vote to leave the EU.
Within hours of the Brexit result being announced on June 24, Mr Jones said he feared it would cost Wales jobs.
In his article, to be published on Friday, Mr Davies said the first minister had been "particularly vociferous in his doom-laden economic forecasting, and in denigrating those who chose to leave".
"He has closed the doors on cross-party negotiation and now, having lost his nerve, seems unable to negotiate a deal for Wales, resorting instead to finger-wagging and pronouncements of 'I told you so'," Mr Davies wrote.
Plaid Cymru's call for independence "betrays how out of kilter they are with the needs of Welsh communities", he added.
"The prophets of doom and the independence mongers alike are wrong to take such a warped view of referendum result."
Mr Davies urged his political opponents to "lift their eyes to the sky and consider the limitless potential that now lies ahead of us and to embrace the outcome".

===Input Doc/Src: The up and down motion can fracture the ice, potentially aiding its break-up and melting, the researchers told Nature magazine.
They say storm swells may have a much bigger influence on the extent of polar sea ice than previously recognised.
The New Zealand-led team ran its experiments off Antarctica.
They placed sensors at various distances from the edge of the pack ice, and then recorded what happened when bad weather whipped up the ocean surface.
For smaller waves, less than 3m in height, the bobbing induced in the floes quickly decayed. But for waves over 3m, the disturbance sent propagating through the pack ice was sustained for up to 350km.
"At the ice edge, it's quite noisy," explained study lead author Alison Kohout, from New Zealand's National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research in Christchurch.
"You have lots of waves coming from all directions with a full spectrum of frequencies. But as the waves move into the ice, this all gets cleaned up to produce one beautiful, smooth wave of constant frequency," she told BBC News.
"The ice floes bend with the waves, and over time you can imagine that this creates fatigue and eventually the ice will fracture. Interestingly, the fractures tend to be perpendicular to the direction of the waves, and to be of even widths."
Computer modellers have been trying to simulate the recent trends in polar sea ice - without a great deal of success.
They have failed to capture both the very rapid decline in summer ice cover in the Arctic and the small, but nonetheless significant, growth in winter ice in the Antarctic.
Dr Kohout and colleagues say their experiments offer some clues - certainly in the south.
When they compared observed Antarctic marine-ice edge positions from 1997 to 2009 with likely wave heights generated by the weather during that period, they found a strong link.
For example, where storminess was increased, in regions like the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Sea, ice extent was curtailed.

===Input Doc/Src: Activists are unlikely to be throwing themselves off the pier in despair. That's not really the Lib Dem way. The party has always thrived in adversity. The conference hashtag is #LibDemfightback.
But it will be a bittersweet experience for some party members.
"This is bound to be an emotional conference for us," writes Caron Lindsay, editor of LibDem Voice.
The party's "brutal" defeat in May is still raw, she adds. "Being with our friends, mulling it all over with laughter, the odd tear and a whole load of gallows humour will undoubtedly help with that."
Here is a full rundown of the main speeches and debates.
The party is talking up the fact that it has gained 20,000 members since May's general election - and about 2,500 of them are going to be in Bournemouth. This is a record, according to party sources, surpassing the number of party members at the 2010 post-election gathering.
"It's going to be a busy, buzzy conference," says Lib Dem activist Mark Pack.
But it will still be a very different kind of Lib Dem conference to those we saw during the coalition years.
There will be no government ministers speaking from the main stage for one thing.
It is likely to feel more sparsely populated too. The corporate lobbyists who flooded into Lib Dem conferences during the coalition years have all but deserted the party. This means the bars and restaurants will be quieter and there will be far fewer fringe meetings. Far fewer journalists too.
The party's new leader Tim Farron has long been a darling of grassroots Lib Dem activists but the general public have little idea who he is.
He will be under pressure to do something about that this week - and also to stake out exactly where the party stands in the rapidly changing landscape of British politics.

===Input Doc/Src: Media playback is not supported on this device
Even fewer could have imagined just how the game would ebb and flow, and ultimately provide Aberdeen with their first chance in 17 years to win a cup they treated as their own in the eighties.
In 1990, as Alex McLeish lifted the trophy just as Willie Miller had done four times in the preceding decade, it would have seemed inconceivable they would not do so again.
But those are the bare facts. And four consecutive losing semi-finals ensured no-one took victory today for granted.
And yet Aberdeen began the match with such a sense of authority and superiority that all doubt seemed to have been banished inside the opening 25 minutes.
Their desire to press Hibernian paid off in the opening seconds - a swifter reward than Derek McInnes could have possibly dreamed of.
But it was a tactic they continued to employ to great effect, snapping into tackles and denying the Hibernian backline and midfield any time or space to develop their game-plan.
The ploy looked a masterstroke from McInnes, but then Neil Lennon changed the game with one of his own.
The introduction of Grant Holt and a change of shape brought Hibs back from the dead - all of a sudden Hibs were able to play the ball forward and not find it coming instantly back on top of them.
Again his goal was a quicker pay-off than Lennon could have hoped for, but his overall impact - in particular his pass for Dylan McGeouch's equaliser - was phenomenal.
That equaliser came moments after another tactical switch - this time by Derek McInnes - whose decision to move to a back three appeared to play into Hibernian's hands.
The Hibs comeback was a significant test of Aberdeen's resolve. Having been so comfortable for 30 minutes, they were rattled by Holt's goal and at 2-2 the clever money was on the resurgent men from Leith.
But Aberdeen's determination to avoid a fifth successive Scottish Cup semi-final defeat kicked in and they clawed their way back into the game.

The council said budget cuts had forced it to give up the attractions.
Only one organisation has so far expressed interest.
Beaumaris courthouse and gaol, and Melin Llynnon and its ancient roundhouses, near Llanddeusant, are currently run by the council's museums and culture service.
Anglesey's head of learning, Delyth Molyneux, said: "Given the significant financial pressures faced and the fact that these sites don't form part of a statutory service, there's a real possibility that they will have to be mothballed or closed altogether if no one else can be found to run them."
Politicians had expressed concerns the courthouse and gaol could be sold to developers.
Beaumaris town councillor Jason Zalot said a sub-committee had been set up to look into running the Beaumaris gaol and courthouse.
"It's a massive undertaking for us. But bear in mind the town council have already taken over the management of the toilets.

===Input Doc/Src: The Under-20 boss replaces Gareth Southgate, who vacated the role to become England manager after the departure of Sam Allardyce.
Boothroyd, 45, took charge for the U21 side's final two Euro 2017 qualifiers and secured qualification for this summer's finals in Poland.
"I've been at the FA three years; this is the logical next step," he said.
"I believe I am here on merit because I've worked in all four divisions and I've got an understanding of speaking to a League Two manager or a Premier League manager and the problems they have."
Boothroyd was in charge of Watford for three seasons from 2005, initially saving the club from relegation to the third tier before leading them to the top flight in 2006.
The Vicarage Road side finished bottom of the Premier League the following season, then failed to make an immediate return, losing in the play-off semi-finals.
Boothroyd left the following season and had a nine-month spell at Colchester and an 11-month stint at Coventry before taking charge at Northampton in 2011.
The side were bottom of League Two at the time and Boothroyd guided them to safety, and the play-offs the next season, before being sacked in 2013 with the club once again last in the fourth tier.
"You can get stuck in a job and I was very much on a hamster's wheel in my previous jobs," he told BBC Radio 5 live.

===Input Doc/Src: Andy Clewes had the transplant in Manchester after his friend Helen Crowther agreed to become a donor.
The 46-year-old suffered chronic kidney disease since birth and was on the verge of needing dialysis treatment.
Mr Clewes and Ms Crowther, 45, are now planning "a curry and a few beers" to celebrate the successful procedure, which was carried out in January.
"I've just got so much more energy now," Mr Clewes, a radio DJ from Crewe, Cheshire, said.
"There was a time when I could sleep 23-hour days, but now I struggle to get myself off to bed.
"It's hard to describe how it feels. Every now and then you remember how lucky you are to have your mate's kidney."
Mr Clewes said the pair would like to get involved in charity work to support others in need of transplants - and may even take on an extreme challenge.
"There are a few organisations who do skydives and things like that, and I've never done something like that before," he said.
"I think it's something I'd like to look at once I'm fully recovered."
Although his strength has returned, Mr Clewes will continue to need regular check-ups and medication to prevent his body rejecting the organ.
But he added: "I'm feeling great. I'm exercising. It's really a life-changing step and I don't want to let Helen down."
Ms Crowther, a charity worker from Runcorn, met her friend at a fundraising event in 2006 and later became "best woman" at his wedding.
She said: "I think Andy's a bit worried he might now take on some of my characteristics.
"I think his wife might like that as he might start tidying up around the house a bit more.
"We met up about four weeks after the operation and just fell back into normal every day chatting really.
"We have plans to celebrate properly and knowing Andy it will probably just be a few beers and curry."
About 3,000 people have kidney transplants each year in the UK and about a third of these are from living donors.
You can find more information on the NHS Organ Donation website.

===Input Doc/Src: The effervescent flanker has shone in an Edinburgh side swamped by malaise.
And Watson proved one of the stars of Scotland's best Six Nations since 2006.
"If you're a score down in a Test with 15 minutes to go and need to inject something different, a player like him might work for you," Smith said.
"Someone a bit more dynamic, with a huge work-rate, hugely athletic and fast, and could probably play in most positions in the backs and make a reasonable fist of it.
"He doesn't fit the mould of a standard back-row. He's not physically massive, but he punches above his weight.
"Every time he gets the ball, he does something interesting and he's very good over the ball.
"It probably goes to your philosophy when you play New Zealand - how are you going to play? Are you going to play all-out attack or are you going to try and stop them from scoring tries?
"Defence is obviously going to be important, but I think we're going to have focus on scoring tries, which I think would probably work in Hamish's favour."
Former prop Smith, 45, toured with the storied Lions of 1997, starting all three Tests as the visitors overcame then world champions South Africa.
He repeated that feat four years later, cementing his status as the first-choice loose-head when Graham Henry's Lions were beaten 2-1 by Australia.
Not since Smith in 2001 has Scotland contributed a starting Test Lion and no more than three Scots have been selected for the initial touring party in two decades.
Head coach Warren Gatland will name his squad on Wednesday.
"If we got five, I'd be pretty happy," Smith told BBC Scotland. "I think Stuart Hogg's a certainty, he's pencilled in by a lot of people to start the Tests and I think, if he keeps playing the way he has been, there's a good chance that will happen.
"I think Jonny Gray is the sort of player that will develop and really come on in a tour and environment like that.

===Input Doc/Src: The unusual move by the agency came after White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer cited claims first made on US TV channel Fox News earlier this week.
GCHQ responded by saying the allegations were "nonsense, utterly ridiculous and should be ignored".
Mr Trump has claimed that Trump Tower in New York was under surveillance.
The GCHQ claims were initially made by former judge Andrew Napolitano.
Mr Spicer quoted Mr Napolitano as saying: "Three intelligence sources have informed Fox News that President Obama went outside the chain of command.
"He didn't use the NSA, he didn't use the CIA, he didn't use the FBI and he didn't use the Department of Justice, he used GCHQ."
A GCHQ spokesman said: "Recent allegations made by media commentator Judge Andrew Napolitano about GCHQ being asked to conduct 'wiretapping' against the then president-elect are nonsense.
"They are utterly ridiculous and should be ignored."
It is unusual for GCHQ to comment directly on a report about its intelligence work, normally preferring to stick to the policy of neither confirming nor denying any activity.
But the allegations are so sensitive that the agency clearly felt they could not let them go unchallenged.
Donald Trump's claim that the Obama administration had ordered surveillance on him has generated enormous attention but with so far little evidence to back it up.
And British intelligence is clearly determined to avoid being drawn into what is an increasingly toxic row in Washington.
A Senate committee has concluded that there are "no indications" Trump Tower was under surveillance by the US government before or after the election.
The statement from Senate Intelligence Committee chairman Richard Burr dismissed Mr Trump's claim his phones were tapped.
Mr Trump had accused his predecessor Barack Obama of wiretapping Trump Tower during the presidential race.
Mr Spicer said Mr Trump maintained his claims.
---Sum/Tgt: Britain's communications intelligence agency GCHQ has issued a statement denying it wiretapped Donald Trump during the US presidential campaign.

It is believed that one or more of the packages burst during the flight.
A Portuguese woman in her 40s, also on the flight from Lisbon, was arrested on suspicion of drugs offences.
It is not clear if her arrest is linked to the man's death.
Toxicology tests have been carried out on the consignment found in the man's stomach, which reportedly had a street value of around Â£40,000 ($61,900).

Police described it as a sectarian hate crime.
The Orange Order said more windows were smashed at about 19:00 GMT on Thursday. The same hall was damaged five years ago in an arson attack.
The damage to the hall discovered on Wednesday is thought to have been caused during the previous night.
Inspector David McIlwaine said that the damage was caused to the rear of the building.
An Orange Order spokesman described those responsible as "mindless thugs intent on causing community division."
He said: "This was an act of wanton vandalism with the clear intention to cause damage and destruction to Orange property.
"However, the culprits are actually harming the wider community and groups who use the hall as a social hub and meeting place."

===Input Doc/Src: The 25-year-old has agreed a three-year deal with the European champions from the start of the 2017-18 season.
The switch - announced last month - will end a six-year association with the Scarlets which has seen Williams score 26 tries in 102 appearances.
"It was an opportunity I couldn't turn down," said Williams, who lines up for Wales against Scotland on Saturday.
"Hopefully, I'll go there and be part of a side that wins a couple more trophies.
"Saracens are European champions and were in another final two or three years ago. They've been English champions for a couple of years running."
The 40-time capped wing or full-back added that living closer to his girlfriend Sophie Harries, a London-based model, was another factor in his decision.
"It's a new chapter. I'm ready to try something different and looking forward to it," he added.
"I still have some games left for the Scarlets. We're looking to make the top four in the Pro12 and get into the play-offs and I want to help them achieve that.
"It would be brilliant if we could win a trophy this season."
Williams has not given up on adding the 2017 Six Nations title to his trophy cabinet.
The 21-16 defeat by England leaves Wales third in the table on five points, but Williams believes a win against Scotland - also on five points - could rekindle their challenge.
After Scotland, Wales play Ireland at home before rounding off their tournament with a trip to France.
"We have three tough games to play," said Williams, who has scored against Italy and England.

"We have to get our performances right and make sure we win our next three games. There's still a chance we could win the championship."

===Input Doc/Src: Two communities are claiming compensation and want Shell to clean up their land.
Shell said it is at an "early stage" in reviewing the claims and that the case should be heard in Nigeria.
The Ogale community of about 40,000 people in Rivers State, on the coast of Nigeria, who are mainly farmers or fishermen, are some of the claimants.
Their case is being handled by law firm Leigh Day.
Spills since 1989 have meant they don't have clean drinking water, farmland or rivers, their claim says.
It points to a November 2015 report by Amnesty International which says four spill sites Shell says it planned to clean up are still contaminated.
The first court hearing at the Technology and Construction Court, held on Wednesday, found that the claimants can can lodge a case against Shell's Nigerian business, known as Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (SPDC).  Shell declined to comment on the ruling.
Amnesty's findings followed a 2011 report by United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) which found water contaminated with oil by-products including benzene, thought to be a carcinogen. It suggested a clean up, but said a "sustainable recovery" of the area could take up to 30 years.
Shell says it has agreed a clean-up plan.
"In mid-2015 SPDC JV, along with the government, UNEP and representatives of the Ogoni community, agreed to an 18-month roadmap to fast-track the environmental clean-up and remediation of Ogoniland which includes a governance framework," it said in a statement.
The Bille community, who are mainly fishermen and are the other party to sue, claims Shell should be liable for "failing to protect their pipelines from damage caused by third parties", according to Leigh Day.
Pipelines in the area have been targets for thieves who steal crude oil and try to refine it locally. This has lead to more spills and damage though explosions.

===Input Doc/Src: As Republican National Committee head Reince Priebus has pointed out, the rules are the rules, and they aren't a secret.
But Mr Trump is right that there are forces coalescing to stop him. And as of Sunday night - with the announcement that presidential candidates John Kasich and Ted Cruz are co-ordinating their efforts in upcoming state primaries - those forces aren't so silent anymore.
Neither Mr Cruz nor Mr Kasich can win the 1,237 delegates necessary to secure the Republican nomination for themselves. Their only hope is to deny Donald Trump that opportunity as well. And now, at last, their campaigns are publicly acknowledging that they need each other's help to do so.
As the two campaigns explained in dual press releases, Mr Cruz will focus on Indiana on 3 May, while Mr Kasich will be given free rein to challenge Mr Trump head-on in the Oregon and New Mexico contests over the following weeks.
This announcement comes just days before Mr Cruz and Mr Kasich are likely to receive a thorough drubbing in a handful of states in the mid-Atlantic, including delegate-rich Pennsylvania.
By Wednesday morning Mr Trump could have put considerably more distance between himself and his two opponents. So this accord may be an early effort to push the focus past the next round of voting and on to more friendly contests.
Indiana, one of the last big prizes of the primary season, is shaping up to be a pivotal battleground. A recent poll shows Mr Trump with a comfortable lead in a three-way race that narrows considerably if Mr Kasich is taken out of the equation.
Given the rules in Indiana - 30 delegates to the candidate who wins a statewide plurality and three delegates to the top finisher in each of the state's nine congressional districts - every bit of help Mr Cruz can get to edge past Mr Trump will be invaluable.
Independent groups backing the #NeverTrump efforts are pouring resources into the state in the hopes that a massive advertising blitz will dent the New York mogul's im

===Input Doc/Src: Glasgow Sheriff Court has previously heard that Harry Clarke was unconscious at the wheel when the lorry hit pedestrians on 22 December last year.
First Bus inspector John Stewart told the FAI that Mr Clarke had blacked out while unwell at a bus stop in 2010.
The inquiry is examining the bin lorry, its route and Mr Clarke's health.
Mr Stewart told the second day of the FAI, which is being overseen by Sheriff John Beckett QC, that he was an inspector and had been with First Bus Glasgow for 12 years.
He referred to notes he had taken on a Blackberry, detailing an incident involving Mr Clarke, while he was a bus driver, on 7 April 2010.
The notes of his daily report from that day state Mr Clarke "blacked out for a couple of minutes" while at a bus stop having "taken unwell".
Mr Stewart said he was alerted by a passenger on the number 54 bus that the driver had collapsed at the wheel.
The witness said Mr Clarke was still in the driver's seat of the bus when he arrived at the scene, but there were no passengers on board.
An ambulance was called and paramedics arrived to attend to Mr Clarke who was given the all clear and refused to go to hospital.
He was not allowed to drive the bus back, which was returned to the depot by Mr Stewart.
The witness said his involvement ended as soon as he left Mr Clarke and that he assumed the driver would have been sent to the company doctor.
Mr Stewart, under cross-examination from Dorothy Bain QC, agreed that "other people could be killed" due to a driver being "out of control" of the bus.
The witness said he did not know if a driver who had blacked out would be suspended, but he said he would not let them drive.
Going back over Mr Stewart's report, it was noted that Mr Clarke had driven the bus to the stop he was at after blacking out.
Mr Stewart said Mr Clarke "should have used his common sense" and not driven the bus, but said "you would have to ask him".
Ms Bain asked Mr Stewart if knew that Mr Clarke was suspended from driving and

===Input Doc/Src: An agreement has been reached to remove compulsory unit assessments from all National 5 and Higher courses.
The EIS said the move will "lighten the assessment burden for pupils and teachers".
The industrial action had threatened to disrupt work for the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA).
EIS general secretary Larry Flanagan said: "I can confirm that EIS Council has now agreed to suspend our programme of industrial action in relation to excessive SQA-related workload.
"The agreement that has now been reached at the CfE (Curriculum for Excellence) management board, based on a proposal submitted by the EIS, is a significant victory for teachers and pupils in our secondary schools.
"The changes that have been agreed, to permanently remove compulsory unit assessments from all National 5 and Higher courses, will ease the assessment burden on pupils and teachers and create time and space for deeper learning and teaching in our classrooms."
Deputy First Minister John Swinney said: "This is welcome news from the EIS and I am delighted that they have confirmed suspending a programme of industrial action in relation to teacher workload.
"Over the past few months, I have listened carefully to what teachers, parents, young people and others have had to say on workload, and have responded positively with a range of actions to help reduce workload pressures. As part of this, I have now announced the removal of mandatory unit assessments from National 5, Higher and Advanced Higher courses.
"This will significantly reduce the workload for our teachers, giving them more time to focus on what is most important - teaching our young people - while maintaining the core principles of Curriculum for Excellence."
Mr Swinney added: ""I am glad that the EIS have recognised these efforts and I hope that together we can move forward to ensure that teachers in Scotland have more time to teach, and contribute to closing the attainment gap."

===Input Doc/Src: With the Women's Big Bash League over, Heather Knight reflects on another winter down under, pays tribute to one of her predecessors as England captain, is "put to shame by a 105-year-old", and looks ahead to a trip to Rwanda.
We've played some brilliant cricket but have been a little bit inconsistent through the year. Saying that, we've managed to punch above our weight for a second year in a row and make it to the semi-finals, despite many predictions to the contrary.
I've really enjoyed my time in the WBBL once again. It's definitely grown since last year with more publicity, more coverage and it's great to see some bigger crowds too.
The double-headers with the men's Big Bash League are, I think, definitely the way forward until the competition grows enough to stand by itself - although it would be great to see the time gap between the end of the women's matches and the start of the men's games reduced, in order to get more people to come to both.
The live online streaming of every WBBL match, outside of the TV broadcast fixtures, has been a very good addition, with highlights of every game available freely, and the social media presence has also been great.
Unfortunately I got roped into embarrassing myself with my woeful singing, featuring in the Hurricanes' rendition of Taylor Swift's "Shake It Off" on the WBBL Pitch Perfect show with Aussie comedian Bobby. Note: the costumes were to try to mask our dreadful voices!
I think there is a lot that can be learned from the WBBL to take into the ECB's second season of the Kia Super League this summer.
Having two expanding domestic competitions in Australia and England will only help the global development of the women's game, so hopefully the Super League will bounce off the back of the second WBBL, and of course the ICC Women's World Cup on home soil in June and July.

===Input Doc/Src: BitTorrent Sync uses peer-to-peer technology to send information between users' PCs.
It eliminates the need to upload data to a third party's computer servers, as is the case with services such as Dropbox, Google Drive and SkyDrive.
But one analyst said businesses were unlikely to be tempted by the idea.
Davies Murphy Group's Chris Green said companies would worry about their lack of control over the new process even though it did not rely on a third-party's data centre to update what might be sensitive files.
But he said it might appeal to some members of the public for private use.
BitTorrent is an eight-year old San Francisco-based company offering a range of free-to-use products designed to make it easy and quick to send large files over the internet.
They work by co-ordinating the process so that devices downloading material also share small pieces of already-accessed data with others in order to share the load.
Although the technology has become associated with media piracy due to its use by some media-sharing sites, BitTorrent itself is a legal company that makes money by licensing its technology and brands to business customers.
It began testing the new tool at the start of the year. The facility is categorised as alpha - signalling it is still being tested and may be unstable - but the firm announced on its blog that it was now ready to invite the public to try it out.
It suggested users might find it quicker and more private than the alternatives.
"Since Sync is based on P2P [peer-to-peer technology] and doesn't require a pit-stop in the cloud, you can transfer files at the maximum speed supported by your network," it said.
"Your information is never stored on a server in the cloud; your data is protected by encrypted keys. Your files belong to you, and stay on the devices of your choice."
To prevent unauthorised access to shared data, the software generates a private key for each synched folder on the original device.

January: 'Super-rare' Nintendo games hits eBay
Fans of old video games were queuing up to get their hands on a copy of Nintendo World Championships, one of only 116 copies made as part of a special event in 1990.
A first bid of $4,999 (Â£3,000) set the tone for the eBay auction.
Even though the cartridge was in poor condition, its rarity - designed for a competition and never put on general sale - meant it would be something of a holy grail for keen collectors, according to gaming experts.
The game eventually sold to a bidder for over $99,0000 - although the winning bidder later backed out.

===Input Doc/Src: The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) said there were "major issues" in the way allergies were recorded and shared.
In its first guidelines on allergy, it is calling for known allergies to be recorded on all prescriptions.
The charity Allergy UK said a "lack of awareness" was putting lives at risk.
Official data recorded 18,079 incidents of drug allergies affecting patient safety in the NHS in England and Wales between 2005 and 2013.
Most involved medicines which were prescribed to a patient with a known allergy to that class of drugs.
Prof Mark Baker, the director of the centre for clinical practice at NICE, said: "If we know that giving someone a particular drug could cause them harm, or in the worst instances may even kill them, the utmost care must be taken to ensure they are not prescribed or administered that drug."
NICE said efforts were needed to "dispel confusion" over allergies after "major issues" were discovered as the guidelines were drawn up.
It called for improvements in the way doctors collect information on patients' allergies. It also wants a re-design of all prescriptions to include information on the classes of drugs to which a patient is known to be allergic.
Signs of allergy include fever, hives, wheezing, redness and swelling.
Dr Shuaib Nasser, a consultant allergist at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, stated: "The guideline stresses the care all healthcare professionals must take when documenting new drug allergies and the importance of sharing this information with patients and other healthcare professionals.
"People should be provided with structured written information on drugs to avoid and be advised to check with their pharmacist before taking over-the-counter medicines.
"In some cases, specialist investigations will be required to confirm or exclude drug allergy."

Areas affected include Bonnyrigg, Loanhead, Fairmilehead, Colinton, Sighthill, South Gyle, Oxgangs, Kirkliston and Bo'ness.
The work will resurface runway areas particularly the touchdown zones.
The airport said 16 flights would operate during the renovations, and the main runway would reopen before 06:00 each morning.
Gordon Dewar, chief executive of Edinburgh Airport, said: "As the airport continues to grow our runway is subjected to heavier loads and more frequent aircraft movements.
"These heavy forces can cause the runway surface to degrade over time.

===Input Doc/Src: He will star in the project, translated as Stalin's Sofa, which will be directed by actress Fanny Ardant, said The Hollywood Reporter.
The film is based on French author Jean-Daniel Baltassat's 2013 novel.
Depardieu was presented with a Russian passport by Vladimir Putin in 2013 after moving to avoid higher taxes in his native France.
Mr Depardieu's move to Russia came after he criticised French President Francois Hollande's plans to raise taxes to 75% for those earning more than 1m euros (Â£817,400).
The actor accused the government of punishing "success, creation and talent".
In 2011, he played the lead role in the film Rasputin, a Franco-Russian production about the life of eccentric monk.
He also recently announced a movie about WW2 French fighter aces who flew alongside Red Air Force pilots over the Eastern Front.
Josef Stalin, the supreme ruler of the Soviet Union for more than 25 years, helped the allies defeat Nazism.

===Input Doc/Src: Laura Stewart, 20, was walking on North Hanover Street with her friend Mhairi Convy, 18, when they were hit by a Range Rover on 17 December.
The funeral of Ms Stewart, an accounts student from Cumbernauld, was held at Our Lady and St Helen's Parish Church in her home town.
About 200 people attended the ceremony to pay their respects.
Outside the church floral tributes were laid, including the name "Laura" written out in red and white flowers opposite the word "sister" in purple flowers.
Tributes left with the flowers included a card saying "with all our love for always, mum and dad" and another to a "beautiful" girl who was a "loving friend and sister".
The order of service showed a photo of the student with the words "Courage grows strong at a wound" - the motto of the Stewart clan.
Mourners wept as the white coffin with purple handles was carried out of the church to the hymn Walk With Me Oh My Lord.
Father Gerald Sharkey led the procession out of the church through the snow. The body was then driven to Eastfield Cemetery in Cumbernauld for a private burial.
Ms Stewart and Ms Convy, of Lennoxtown, studied at Glasgow College of Commerce.
Following the crash, the two women were taken to Glasgow Royal Infirmary, where they died.
A 36-year-old male pedestrian and the 50-year-old male driver of the Range Rover were also treated in hospital after the crash.
Strathclyde Police are investigating the deaths.

The five-time world champion accused World Snooker of bullying after his first-round win at the World Championship on Sunday.
World Snooker chairman Barry Hearn has said the claims are "unfounded".
In a statement released on Tuesday, 41-year-old O'Sullivan said his legal team would address the issues at the end of the tournament at Sheffield's Crucible.
He also said he would make no further comment on the matter during the event, but would focus instead on winning a sixth world title.
"There has been some speculation and commentary around the answers I gave when questioned by the media at my press conference on Sunday.
"Any outstanding issues with the snooker authorities will be addressed by my legal team following the conclusion of this great event, when I hope a sensible resolution can be reached.
"I will not be making any further comment about this during the World Championships. I request the press and media respect this position in all further interviews.
"I wish to focus all my energies on performing to the very best of my ability for the fans in my quest for a sixth world title."

===Input Doc/Src: Revenue Scotland is responsible for the administration and collection of Land and Building Transaction Tax (LBTT) and Scottish Landfill Tax (SLfT).
It collected £425m through LBTT and £147m from SLfT in the year from 1 April 2015 to 31 March 2016.
The Scottish government had originally forecast revenues of £498m in 2015-16, which was later increased to £508m.
Almost all (98%) of the 115,000 tax returns were submitted through the new online Scottish Electronic Tax System, exceeding an initial target of 90%.
Revenue Scotland's operating costs for administering the collection of taxes was £4.67m - lower than the Scottish government's original £4.81m budget allocation for the organisation.
Revenue Scotland's chairman, Dr Keith Nicholson, said the agency's first year had been "hugely successful", with the online tax system having "exceeded expectations and received widespread praise".
He added: "These achievements are a clear signal to the Scottish taxpayer that Revenue Scotland is operating efficiently and effectively as Scotland's devolved tax authority."
Welcoming the figures, Finance Secretary Derek Mackay said: "The scale of the challenge of introducing the first Scottish taxes in more than 300 years should not be underestimated, and it's encouraging to see this has been done so effectively."
LBTT and SLfT  came into effect on 1 April 2015, replacing their UK equivalents (Stamp Duty Land Tax and UK Landfill Tax respectively) in Scotland.
The revenue collected is transferred to the Scottish Consolidated Fund to support the delivery of public services in Scotland.
Revenue Scotland will also collect a Scottish replacement for Air Passenger Duty when it is introduced, but will not administer the Scottish Rate of Income Tax, which will continue to be the responsibility of HMRC.
---Sum/Tgt: Scotland's new tax agency has collected £572m in its first year - well above the amount that had been expected.

===Input Doc/Src: It comes after two cabinet ministers stepped down on Tuesday over separate scandals, which means a political reshuffle is likely in 2016.
Liberal senator Eric Abetz called for Mr Abbott to make a comeback saying he has "more to offer public life".
Abbott was unseated by current Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in September.
"I'm on the record as saying that I believe Tony Abbott has more to offer public life in Australia," Mr Abetz told the Australian Broadcasting Corp (ABC).
"I hope that he stays in the Parliament and I hope that there will be a place for him, a prominent place for him, in any future ministry should he decide to stay.
Another politician calling for Mr Abbott's return was Nationals Senator John Williams, who told the ABC the move would help "heal the wounds of the past".
Cities minister Jamie Briggs resigned yesterday after a female public servant lodged an official complaint about his behaviour in a Hong Kong bar in September.
Mr Briggs said that he had failed to live up to the high standards expected of a government minister.
Special Minister for State Mal Brough also stepped aside pending the result of a federal police investigation into alleged his role in the illegal procurement of a rival politician's private diary.
Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss, who leads the Nationals, is widely predicted to retire from politics before the next federal election.
An announcement on Mr Truss's future would provide the catalyst for Mr Turnbull to reshuffle his frontbench.
---Sum/Tgt: Supporters of former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott have made calls for him to return to a senior government position.

===Input Doc/Src: The comment by the public services minister led Plaid Cymru to vote against the Public Health Bill, which included a partial ban on e-cigarettes.
One Plaid AM has called Mr Andrews' attitude "wholly offensive".
But Carwyn Jones said it was a joke and that Plaid had not acted maturely and "people say things in the chamber".
Meanwhile, doctors and nursing unions have called on political parties "not to play games with the health of the nation".
Mr Jones told S4C's Newyddion 9: "People say things and if they had their time again they would say things differently. But to react in this way... that is not a mature response."
"If Leighton had his time again I know he would say something different.
He said Mr Andrews had "offered to apologise, but no".
"Plaid Cymru said they would vote against this no matter what happens with any sort of apology," he said.
As well as a ban on e-cigarette use in some public places, the bill aimed to create a compulsory licensing system for tattooists, ban intimate piercing of children under 16 and require councils to produce a local toilets strategy.
Plaid originally planned a free vote and some of its AMs were expected to support the bill on Wednesday evening, although a greater number were in opposition.
But the party's last minute decision to vote against it as a group meant the assembly was tied 26-26 and the legislation failed.
But Dafydd Elis-Thomas told BBC News he was not informed about Plaid's decision. He had made arrangements to cancel his assembly vote.
"I did not imagine that by not being present I would have helped to lose a piece of important Welsh legislation," Lord Elis-Thomas said.
"I've experienced many low points in this fourth assembly in my relationship with the party, but this is the lowest."
He said he and party leader Leanne Wood, who was against the ban, agreed to not attend the vote - known as pairing - meaning their absences would cancel each other out from the tally.

===Input Doc/Src: Based on CT scans, the organs are fitted into a realistic synthetic "body" and connected to pumps which mimic human breathing and blood flow.
Nottingham Trent University, with the NHS and Ministry of Defence, used silicone gels to replicate the feel of human tissue.
Bespoke models could now be created to prepare for individual operations.
Richard Arm, of Nottingham Trent University's School of Art & Design, said he was asked to come up with a heart model for a surgeon who wanted to practice performing an implant.
He said: "When making more organs, the trickiest part was the flexibility.
"The heart has 17 different 'hardnesses' so 'does it feel right?' turns out to be a bit vague.
"Then we put them together and I knew we were getting it right when I started to feel sick."
The prototype - officially known as a thoracic trauma trainer - will be exhibited to trauma treatment experts.
After feedback, two models are due to be produced for the MoD by December 2017.
Colonel Peter Mahoney, emeritus professor at Defence Medical Services, said the requirement was for training equipment that was portable, robust and reusable, while "also achieving a realism" that had only previously been possible with dead bodies.
He added: "We wanted to start with the chest, because it is a common area connected with trauma, but if it could be created with realistically-moving lungs and blood vessels then any other body parts would be possible."
Future developments could include the brain, eyes, stomach, pancreas, liver and kidneys, the vascular system in a person's legs and bespoke models for patient-specific preoperative surgical planning.

===Input Doc/Src: The star joined forces with her cousin, Senator Charles Schumer, to unveil a set of proposals for more stringent background checks on gun buyers.
"The time is now for American people to rally for these changes," she said.
President Obama recently said the failure to pass gun safety laws was the greatest frustration of his presidency.
His comments came on 23 July, just hours before a gunman opened fire on a movie theatre in Lafayette, Louisiana, killing two women and injuring nine other patrons, before taking his own life.
John Houser, 59, legally purchased his semi-automatic 40-calibre handgun in Alabama in 2014, following a background check that failed to reveal he had a history of psychiatric problems and had been the subject of domestic violence complaints.
Schumer, whose film was playing at the cinema, said the incident sickened her.
"I've thought about these victims each day since the tragedy," she said at a news conference at the senator's office in New York.
"People say, 'Well, you're never going to be able to stop crazy people from doing crazy things,' but they're wrong. There is a way to stop them," she added.
Senator Schumer, a New York democrat, wants to improve background checks by creating financial incentives for states that submit information to a database the FBI uses to screen gun buyers.
His bill would also create penalties for states that fail to submit records to the database. He stressed that the proposals were about strengthening the background check system, not putting new restrictions on buyers.
He also urged Congress to provide full funding to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which faces a proposed 4.4% cut of $159m (Â£101m).
But with gun ownership a contentious issue in US politics, the senator acknowledged he would struggle to get his bill passed into law.

===Input Doc/Src: All three teaching unions are now taking some form of industrial action over their concerns about the new courses.
Problems highlighted include the level of bureaucracy and increased workload.
These are likely to be among the topics raised at a regular meeting involving unions, education chiefs and others.
The group brings together a full range of stakeholders including the Scottish government, the exams body the SQA, senior figures in education such as directors of education from local authorities, all three unions and the council umbrella body Cosla.
But finding a solution which fully addresses the concerns of unions and leads to an end to industrial action will be a challenge.
School qualifications have been through a three-year shake-up.
Standard Grades and Intermediates were scrapped, National 4 and 5 qualifications were introduced and Highers and Advanced Highers were revamped.
Although the shake-up is now complete - and this year's S4 students will be the fourth set of pupils to study for N4s and N5s - some teachers and unions have serious practical worries.
Their concerns are about how the new courses are working out in practice - not the qualifications themselves or the underlying aims of the changes.
One issue concerns ongoing assessments - unit assessments - in the National 5 and Higher courses.
Members of the largest union - the EIS - are now taking part in a partial work-to-rule over their concerns. Teachers are not taking part in work linked to developing the new qualifications unless they are contractually obliged to.
However the work-to-rule should have no direct impact on learners and the union stresses it does not cover other additional activities teachers do such as sports clubs and school trips.
The EIS has argued that there is unnecessary duplication between the assessments and the exams.
The union said it wanted to see an acceptable timetable for a significant reduction in unit assessments and the workload associated with them.

===Input Doc/Src: The lender was the biggest faller on Germany's main stock market before paring back the losses.
Talks between chief executive John Cryan and the US Department of Justice ended without agreement at the weekend, according to reports.
The bank has been under intense pressure over the size of the fine.
Mr Cryan was in the US for the International Monetary Fund and World Bank's autumn meetings.
Some investors had hoped that while he was there, he might negotiate down a settlement for the bank's mis-selling of mortgage-backed securities.
Others, though, said it was always unlikely the bank could strike a deal with the US authorities so quickly.
Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: "Deutsche Bank hasn't as yet been able to come to any agreement with the US Justice Department as it looks to overcome the hurdle of the prospect of a rather large fine.
"Talks are continuing while the bank looks at potentially spinning off a stake in its asset management division in order to free up some extra capital."
Terry Torrison, managing director at McLaren Securities, said the bank was "never going to sort out the US issues that quickly".
Deutsche Bank's shares touched 33-year lows at the end of September, before recovering slightly in recent days, over fears its finances are not strong enough to handle a large US fine.
The bank declined to comment on reports Mr Cryan had failed to reach a deal. The share price recovered to close slightly up by the end of trading.

===Input Doc/Src: The Muslim Personal Law Board told the Supreme Court that men were "better at controlling emotions and unlikely to take a hasty decision".
The board's explanation came after Muslim women complained about gender discrimination in divorce cases.
Activists said the comments were "patriarchal, inhuman and unjust".
The Supreme Court is hearing several petitions challenging what is known as the "instant triple talaq" where a Muslim man can divorce his wife in a matter of minutes by just uttering the word talaq (divorce) three times.
"Their [the All India Muslim Personal Law Board or AIMPLB] stand that 'men have greater reasoning power compared to women' smacks of a medieval mindset and prejudice against women," the Mumbai-based Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan (BMMA - Indian Muslim Women's Movement) and the All India Democratic Women's Association said in a joint statement.
"Their justification of polygamy and triple talaq contravenes the constitution and indeed the principles of gender justice in Islam. Triple talaq is unilateral and arbitrary. Nowhere in the Islamic world is triple talaq legal. We oppose it and demand a ban on it forthwith," the statement added.
The activists said the board should apologise to all women and ensure that their statements in the future were not derogatory to women.
Muslims are India's largest minority community with a population of 155 million and their marriages and divorces are governed by the Muslim personal law, ostensibly based on the sharia.
Women's groups and campaigners say the controversial practice of triple talaq is un-Koranic and must be declared unconstitutional.
Most Islamic countries, including Pakistan and Bangladesh, have banned triple talaq, but it thrives in India, they say.
Islamic scholars too say the Koran clearly spells out how to issue a divorce - it has to be spread over three months which allows a couple time for reflection and reconciliation.

===Input Doc/Src: Jose Salvador Alvarenga thanked the president of the Marshall Islands, where he was found late last month, before boarding a flight to Hawaii.
He says he left Mexico for a trip in a fibre-glass boat in December 2012 with a friend who died on board.
He apparently survived the 8,000 km (5,000-mile) ordeal by catching fish, birds and turtles with his bare hands.
For fluids, he claimed to have drunk urine, rainwater and the blood of birds.
He was rescued on 30 January by people living on the island of Ebon Atoll.
"Thank you for everything the people of the Marshall Islands have done for me during my stay," Mr Alvarenga, 37, said through an interpreter before leaving for Hawaii. He will make his way from there to El Salvador to be reunited with his relatives.
President Christopher Loeak presented him with a woven garland, the AFP news agency reports.
The fisherman had been due to leave last Friday, but doctors said he needed more rest.
The family of his younger friend say they want to speak to Mr Alvarenga to find out more about how their son died, and what happened to his body.
Known as Ezequiel, he is believed to have starved after being unable to eat raw birds and fish.
Three Mexican fishermen were rescued off the Marshall Islands in August 2006 after what they said was about nine months drifting across the Pacific Ocean.
They survived on rain water, seabirds and fish.

"If you are making money and have to pay big money for the best players, why not do it?" Robson told BBC Radio 5 live's Sportsweek programme.
Manager Jose Mourinho wants the deal to be completed before 14 August.
No deal has been announced for Pogba, who has been on holiday in the United States since losing the Euro 2016 final with France against Portugal last month.
Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri has said he expects the midfielder to be at training on Monday, although reports in Italy say Pogba has flown to the UK for a medical.
Manchester United have not responded to these reports.
Pogba played at United for three years before rejecting a new contract and joining Juventus for a £1.5m compensation fee in 2012.
He won the Serie A title in four successive seasons in Italy and has established himself as one of the most highly rated players in the world.
"Sir Alex Ferguson allowed me to watch training as Pogba joined the first team squad [as a teenager]," said Robson.
"I was very impressed with him. He was a good build, with a good temperament.
"He is the type of player we need.

===Input Doc/Src: The lender said that property prices grew by 3.6% in the three months to the end of July compared with the previous quarter.
The monthly increase was 1.4% compared with June, making the average home worth Â£186,332.
The figures are at odds with other surveys which suggest a slowdown.
This is the first time since September 2007 that the annual change has gone above 10%, according to the Halifax. It accelerated from an 8.8% rise in June.
"While supply remains low, housing demand continues to be supported by a continuing economic recovery, growth in employment, improving consumer confidence and low mortgage rates," said Stephen Noakes, mortgages director at the Halifax.
The numbers, based on its own mortgage lending, counter the view put forward by rival lender Nationwide, which said prices had started to moderate.
The Nationwide's estimate of the annual house price rise slowed from 11.8% in June to 10.6% in July.
The year-on-year comparison is calculated slightly differently by the two lenders. The Halifax compares the previous three months with the same three months a year earlier to give a smoother comparison, rather than a direct comparison of the equivalent months as calculated by the Nationwide.
The Land Registry has also suggested that seven out of 10 regions of England and Wales showed a monthly fall in prices, although these short-term price changes are often volatile.
Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist for IHS Global Insight, said: "On balance, we take the view that house prices will keep on clearly rising over the coming months but there will be some moderation from the recent peak levels."
Halifax is part of Lloyds Banking Group, which recently announced that it was moving to reduce its share of mortgages under the government's Help to Buy scheme.
Borrowers are now able to raise a maximum of Â£150,000 through Help to Buy, down from Â£500,000.

===Input Doc/Src: "We will absolutely want him to have the death penalty," Nikki Haley told NBC television.
Suspect Dylann Roof, 21, is due to make his first court appearance on Friday.
He was arrested on Thursday more than 200 miles away in North Carolina and flown back to South Carolina.
Police are treating the killings at the Emanuel AME Church on Wednesday evening as a hate crime.
Prayer vigils have been held in churches in Charleston and across the US for the six women and three men who died.
At the vigil for victim Sharonda Singleton, her teenage children told the BBC they had forgiven her killer and wanted to focus on moving on in a positive way.
"We already forgive him for what he's done," said her son, Chris.
"And there's nothing but love from our side of the family. Love is stronger than hate."
Churches in Charleston were full to overflowing on Thursday evening as prayer services were held. Some services were held outdoors.
Hundreds gathered outside the Emanuel AME Church to pay tribute.
Governor Haley told NBC's Today show that South Carolina had been "hurt" by the deaths of nine innocent people.
She said she wanted the suspect tried on state charges in South Carolina rather than federal charges.
Mr Roof is due to appear in court via video link for a bail hearing on Friday. He is being held at a detention centre in the Charleston area, the county sheriff's office said.
He was detained on Thursday after police acting on a tip-off stopped his car in Shelby, North Carolina.

===Input Doc/Src: The bucardo became extinct in 2000, but cells from the last animal were frozen in liquid nitrogen.
In 2003, a cloned calf was brought to term but died a few minutes after birth.
Now, the scientists will test the viability of the female bucardo's 14-year-old preserved cells.
The bucardo, or Pyrenean ibex, calf born through cloning was an historic event: the first "de-extinction", in which a lost species or sub-species was resurrected.
The Aragon Hunting Federation signed an agreement with the Centre for Research and Food Technology of Aragon (CITA) in Zaragoza to begin preliminary work on the cells from the last animal, named Celia.
One of the scientists behind the cloning effort, Dr Alberto Fernandez-Arias, told BBC News: "At this moment, we are not initiating a 'bucardo recovery plan', we only want to know if Celia's cells are still alive after having been maintained frozen during 14 years in liquid nitrogen."
In addition to this in vitro work, they will also attempt to clone embryos and implant them in female goats.
"In this process, one or more live female bucardo clones could be obtained. If that is the case, the feasibility of a bucardo recovery plan will be discussed," Dr Fernandez-Arias, who is head of the Aragon Hunting, Fishing and Wetlands Service, explained.
The bucardo (Capra pyrenaica pyrenaica) was a sub-species of ibex, with distinct physical and genetic characteristics to other mountain goats inhabiting the Iberian Peninsula. It was perfectly adapted to life in its mountain habitat, and to survive the extreme cold and snow of winter in the Pyrenees.
However, its population had been declining for years for several reasons, including hunting. In April 1999, researchers captured the last animal, a female named Celia. They obtained skin biopsies and froze the tissue in liquid nitrogen at a temperature of -196C (-321F).
The following year, Celia was killed by a falling tree in the National Park of Ordesa in north-east Spain. But a team including Dr Fernan

===Input Doc/Src: The officers said they felt sorry for the migrants, who were found in a lorry in Belgium, and offered to give them a lift to the border.
But they strayed into France, where they were arrested and questioned.
The incident sparked a diplomatic spat, with France's interior minister summoning the Belgian ambassador.
Bernard Cazeneuve had a "frank and clear" meeting with the Belgian ambassador, according to French officials, and expressed his disquiet at what had happened.
France strongly condemned the officers' action which "does not conform to the normal work practices agreed between France and Belgium".
But there was surprise at the French reaction from Georges Aeck, the Ypres police commissioner, because of the two countries' usual close border co-operation.
"We didn't do it for money, this isn't human trafficking," he told Belgian broadcaster RTBF. "We only gave them a hand. We took them a little way in the direction they wanted to go,"
The bizarre chain of events began on Tuesday evening, when French police in an unmarked car stopped the Belgian police van carrying the 13 migrants, including three minors, on the French side of the border in Nieppe, north-west of Lille.
The migrants had been discovered earlier in the day and ordered to leave the country.
But when the officers spotted them walking on foot towards the border, they offered them a lift and accidentally strayed into France near Nieppe.
The two officers were handcuffed, despite identifying themselves, the Belgian police union said.
Vincent Gilles, the president of the Belgian police union, complained that the officers had been treated like "criminal suspects" and held for four hours without access to a lawyer.
Mr Aeck added: "It's the first time this has happened because we have a good relationship with our French colleagues. We sometimes organise the control system together on the border. We are a little surprised.

===Input Doc/Src: Mr Gordhan will be replaced by Malusi Gigaba, said a statement issued late on Thursday by the preisdent's office.
Earlier this week, President Zuma recalled Mr Gordhan from planned events in the UK and US.
Sfiso Buthelezi will become Deputy Finance Minister, replacing Mcebisi Jonas.
"I have directed the new ministers and deputy ministers to work tirelessly with their colleagues to bring about radical socioeconomic transformation and to ensure that the promise of a better life for the poor and the working class becomes a reality," President Zuma's statement said.
Last October, Mr Gordhan was charged with fraud - but the charges were later dropped.
He has described the allegations as politically motivated.
Mr Gordhan has been seen as standing up to President Zuma in cabinet and has warned against corruption becoming rampant.
The South African Communist Party, an ally of the governing African National Congress, had earlier lodged a formal objection to plans to dismiss Mr Gordhan, who is widely respected internationally.
Many senior ANC figures also opposed the finance minister's removal.

===Input Doc/Src: But the inquiry into the attack on the Pulse gay night club, in which 49 people were killed, is being treated as a terrorist investigation, he added.
The FBI's director said the gunman was radicalised through the internet.
Meanwhile Donald Trump said he would suspend immigration from certain areas of the world to the US.
The presumptive Republican presidential candidate also renewed his call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country.
The US authorities say gunman Omar Mateen pledged allegiance to IS shortly before the attack in Florida.
However, the extent of any links to IS remains unclear.
Speaking in Washington, Mr Obama said: "It does appear that at the last minute he [gunman Omar Mateen] announced allegiance to Isil [IS].
"But there is no evidence so far that he was in fact directed.

Responding to the Orlando shootings, Mr Trump reiterated his proposal to ban foreign Muslims from entering the US.

Mr Trump said: "When I'm elected I will suspend immigration from areas of the world where there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies."

===Input Doc/Src: The Canadian singer told BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs that the executive told him his music would not sell.
He told Buble he would only produce his music for $100,000 (Â£82,000) a track, just to get rid of him.
The singer has now sold more than 50 million albums around the world.
Buble started out as a swing crooner and also sings jazz and pop songs.
He told presenter Kirsty Young that David Foster, who has worked with Whitney Houston and Celine Dion, had told him: "You will never be signed to my label, I will never produce you.
"You are talented but I see no record sales for this genre of music.
"To dismiss me, [Foster] said, 'For $100,000 a track, I will produce on spec a record for you, and because I'm an executive of Warner Bros they'll get first right of refusal.
"And then he pushed me out the door thinking he would never see me again."
But the singer said the encounter made him determined to raise the money to work with Foster.
"What he didn't know was that I would go back to Vancouver and go bank to bank with a manager I had at the time and find an investor," Buble said.
"I flew back to Los Angeles and went to David's house, and he said 'What do you want?' And I said 'Mr Foster I have the money.'
"He couldn't believe I had come back. But he said, 'All right', and we started making the record."
Later, Buble explained, he asked Foster if he could speak to the president of Warner Bros and "plead" for the album to be released.
"I walked into the Warner Bros records' home in Burbank, and I don't think I'd ever been as terrified," Buble said.
"This executive named Tom Whalley came in the room and he said 'Why should we sign you? We have [Frank] Sinatra'."
"And I said 'With all due respect, Sinatra's dead, don't bury the music with him.' I said 'I'll work hard and help fill the void and we will keep this music alive together'.

===Input Doc/Src: Pastor James McConnell, 78, denies two charges relating to a sermon he gave in a church last year.
A prosecution lawyer said his words were not "a slip of the tongue", while a defence lawyer said he should not be convicted.
Judgement was reserved, and the verdict will be given on 5 January.
Summing up the prosecution's case, a barrister said Pastor McConnell, of Shore Road, Newtownabbey,  was "not on trial for his beliefs", but for what he said and using words that were allegedly grossly offensive.
"He intended to use those words, it wasn't a slip of the tongue," he told Belfast Magistrates Court.
However, a defence barrister called on the court to find Pastor McConnell not guilty.
He said he was a man with an unblemished record who should be recognised for his good works in society, not convicted in court.
Earlier, Pastor McConnell told the court that he still believed in what he had preached, and did not go into church to "provoke anyone".
He said he only realised he may have offended anyone when he got a call from BBC Radio Ulster's Nolan Show.
"I was attacking the theology of Islam. I was not attacking any individual Muslim," he told the court.
"I didn't realise that good Muslim people would be hurt.
"I didn't go into the church to provoke anyone. I went into church to present the truth."
Asked why he refused an informal warning that would have prevented a criminal trial he said: "If I took it, that would be an insult to the one I love ... that was me gagged for the rest of my life."
DUP MP Sammy Wilson and Catholic priest Fr Patrick McCafferty appeared as character witnesses for Pastor McConnell.
Fr McCafferty said that in spite of their theological differences, the pastor and he shared a Christian love.
"He has no hatred," he said.
Pastor McConnell is charged with improper use of a public electronic communications network and causing a grossly offensive message to be sent by means of a public electronic communications network.

===Input Doc/Src: The firm is to license a new cancer treatment to Californian company Genentech.
The treatment is a class of drug molecules developed by Almac's discovery division.
Genentech will make an upfront payment of around £9m with further payments and possible royalties to follow.
Almac will be eligible to receive up to £225m in milestone payments plus royalties on commercial sales of any products developed by Genentech
The two companies will also run a two-year joint research programme funded by Genentech
The drug molecules are called inhibitors of ubiquitin specific proteases.
They block the activity of an important cancer pathway which is believed to play a key role in tumour development.
Tim Harrison, vice president of drug discovery at Almac, said they have been "a highly sought after, yet elusive drug class, proving difficult to identify despite significant efforts from both pharmaceutical and biotech companies".
He added that there was now "an exciting opportunity to fully exploit this novel biology".
Genentech was founded in San Francisco in 1976 and is widely considered to be the world's most successful biotechnology company.
It has developed products such as the cancer drug Avastin and the stroke treatment Activase.
In 2009, the Swiss drug company Roche took control of Genentech, paying £30bn for the 44% of the firm it did not own.
Meanwhile, California-based CV6 Therapeutics Ltd is to partner with the Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology at Queen's University, Belfast for a research and development project.
The project aims to develop a new drug with the potential to make chemotherapy more effective and represents a total investment of £5.5m.

Ipswich Borough Council received the highest number of complaints over the five years, with 4,568.
Waveney District Council received 3,672 complaints, while Suffolk Coastal District Council had a total of just over 3,000.
Mark Johnson, senior public health officer at St Edmundsbury Borough Council, said the best thing for people to do was to speak with the person making the noise.
"It's the most common sense approach because sometimes they don't even realise they're causing a nuisance to their neighbours," he said.
As for dogs, Candice Rose, owner of Canine Creche in Martlesham, said they could be taught not to bark.
"The key thing is reward and distraction," she said. "We distract them and then reward the good behaviour.
"There are solutions, it could be a behavioural issue, in which case that can be adjusted, but if it's just through boredom - there really is no excuse in this day and age."

===Input Doc/Src: Scientists are recruiting 64 healthy adult volunteers for the trial, which is expected to take up to two years.
The work will be split equally between London, the Rwandan capital Kigali and Nairobi in Kenya.
This early trial is being run by the International Aids Vaccine Initiative (IAVI), a non-profit organisation.
The principal investigator, Dr Jill Gilmour, who has worked at the laboratory at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital since its founding in 2001, says she is optimistic that the Aids virus can eventually be tackled with a vaccine.
The virus is now 30 years old, and the search for a vaccine has proved elusive so far.
However, an American-backed trial in Thailand found in 2009 that a combination of two vaccine prototypes was 30% effective in preventing HIV infection.
Follow-up trials are being planned with the aim of improving those initial results.
In the IAVI trial, volunteers who are free of HIV and not at risk of catching the infection will receive a combination of two vaccines.
One of them is derived from a weakened version of Sendai, a flu-like virus that infects rodents. It will be administered through nasal drops.
This is because in the early stages of infection, both HIV and Sendai affect the mucosal tissues, which are found in the nose and also in the genital area.
Dr Gilmour said: "I believe it's not if, it's when we will have an effective HIV vaccine. There is now strong scientific data to support that position.
"We will get there but vaccine development takes time. It's not for the faint-hearted.
"Bear in mind that with polio, it was 45 years from discovering the virus to getting an effective vaccine.
"HIV is a formidable beast with sneaky tricks. It changes every time it divides, so it's highly variable. And it can integrate into your own cells, so your immune system can't see it."
The trial is early work known as Phase I, meaning that the aim is to ensure the vaccine is safe and induces an immune response.

===Input Doc/Src: The Belfast woman claims she was 15 when she embarked on a sexual relationship with Mr McPeake.
The 72-year-old denies 12 counts of sex offences against her.
She made her claim during her third day in the witness box.
The abuse is alleged to have happened from summer 2009 until February 2010.
She alleged in Belfast Crown Court she became sexually involved with McPeake during a group trip to the Republic of Ireland, and that when the group returned to Belfast, her relationship with Mr McPeake progressed onto intercourse.
The woman was questioned at length about the allegations she had made against Mr McPeake.
When she was asked about an alleged pregnancy scare, the woman said she "panicked" as she was only 15 and that Mr McPeake had lost his temper when she told him.
This, and all her other claims, have been refuted by Mr McPeake, who makes the case that no sexual activity occurred between him and the then schoolgirl in 2009 and 2010.
A defence lawyer questioned the woman about her claims of sexual activity on two cross-border trips as well as alleged incidents she said occurred at the McPeake School of Music in Belfast, at another music workshop in the city and in his car.
Telling the jury it was Mr McPeake's case there was no sexual activity, the lawyer accused the woman of being a disruptive influence during one of the cross-border trips, where she made a nuisance of herself and had to be chastised by Mr McPeake for her bad behaviour.
This suggestion was rejected by the woman, who said that at that time they were in a relationship and she was in love with him.
She was also asked about comments she made about wanting to wreck his life the way he had wrecked hers, and also comments she made to Mr McPeake's son via Facebook about his father.
Breaking down in tears, the woman said she was "angry and hurt" about what Mr McPeake had done.
She said: "All I wanted was an apology, to say he was sorry and that he was wrong. I just wanted an apology from him."

===Input Doc/Src: Mr Davies said it was time to change the name in recognition of the primary law making powers it was granted in a 2011 referendum.
The Welsh word used for the assembly building is Senedd, which translates into English as "parliament".
But the Wales Office indicated that the move was "not a priority".
A spokesman for the Wales Office said any change in the name of the National Assembly would require changes to primary legislation.
Mr Davies, leader of the Conservative group in the National Assembly, the second largest party to Labour, describes himself as a "proud unionist".
He said his suggestion had nothing to do with any greater separation between Wales and the rest of the UK.
He said the move, which he claims would require only a small amendment in existing legislation to be in place by 2016, would be "a statement about the institution which now legislates for our great nation".
Mr Davies, the South Wales Central AM, said: "By voting for full law-making powers last year the people of Wales made their National Assembly a parliament in all but name.
"It's now time to reward their faith in our institution and acknowledge that where laws are made - the title of a parliament should exist. This is a common-sense move.
"It would provide far greater clarity over the distinction between the assembly - as it is currently named - and the Welsh government, and it would give our devolved institution its rightful place alongside other national legislatures.
"As we drive forward it is crucially important that we embrace what we now have. Put simply - a parliament."
ANALYSIS by Adrian Browne, BBC Wales political reporter
Andrew RT Davies' suggestion that the National Assembly should be rebranded as the Welsh Parliament would appear to be aimed at attracting Plaid Cymru voters who might, he hopes, be uneasy about the leadership of Leanne Wood, who is up front about her socialist and republican beliefs.
It could also be seen as an attempt to assert his authority within his party.

===Input Doc/Src: The isle is a mile long (16.km), depending on tides and weather, and separated from the mainland by a (330ft) 100 metre wide channel.
It was first spotted by locals as a "bump" above the water in April, according to the Island Free Press.
Photos taken by a Connecticut tourist have gone viral on Instagram, leading to a boost in curious visitors.
Photographer Chad Koczera described encountering the island during his visit to Cape Point.
"My fiancee and I were driving to the point after a storm to collect shells when we spotted an area we couldn't get to by car," he said.
He described returning for his fifth time to the park, and to visit Cape Point where he had proposed marriage to his then-girlfriend.
"I sent the drone up to check it out and noticed this beautiful island. We didn't get a chance to make it on to the island because of the strong current."
The island is littered with old shipwrecks and whale bones that poke through its sands, says local historian Danny Couch.
Experts say the shores of the Outer Banks are constantly shifting, as sandbars rise above or sink back below the water.
Park superintendent Dave Hallac has cautioned visitors against trying to swim or walk across the channel to reach the island.
Currents can swiftly carry away a person, while sharks and sting rays have been spotted in the area.
Visitors are advised to use a kayak or paddleboard to reach Hatteras Island, as it's been dubbed.

Walker was unexpectedly joined by Maria de Cezar while presenting live on BBC Four from Copacabana beach, and after she joined him for an impromptu on-air chat to discuss her wedding, she has invited him to next month's ceremony.
It comes hot on the heels of FOUR marriage proposals at the Rio Games, meaning Maria's is not the only 'Olympic wedding' on the horizon.
Romance was in the air at the individual dressage on Monday, as Briton Charlotte Dujardin not only retained her title but received a proposal - of sorts - from fiance Dean Golding.
Watching Dujardin from the stands, he wore a sign that read: "Can we get married now?"
After winning gold, Dujardin told BBC Radio 5 live: "He's already asked me. He knows it's 'yes'.
"I'm hopefully going to get married next year. I said I would get married after London but time just flew by. It's definitely on the cards now."
Cupid then found British race walker Tom Bosworth at the Copacabana.
The 26-year-old almost pulled off a shock when he led the 20km walk at the halfway stage, before finishing sixth. On Monday, he surprised boyfriend Harry Dineley with a marriage proposal.
Bosworth's was the third proposal of the Rio Games.
On Sunday, Chinese diver He Zi had just been awarded her women's 3m springboard silver when boyfriend and fellow diver Qin Kai proposed in front of a stunned arena.
She nodded.

The first proposal of the Games came during the first week, when Olympic rugby sevens venue worker Marjorie Enya asked Brazil player Isadora Cerullo to marry her.
"The Olympic Games can look like closure but, for me, it's starting a new life with someone," said Enya. "I wanted to show people that love wins."

===Input Doc/Src: Dominic Colella was called out on 9 March 2013 when the 85-year-old man collapsed in a queue at a London branch of the store.
A colleague told a disciplinary hearing Mr Colella had returned to the ambulance with two "full bags of shopping" after 20 minutes.
He did not attend the hearing.
Giving evidence to the Health and Care Professionals Council, fellow paramedic Yvonne Purves said the elderly man had passed out in M&S and then regained consciousness before being moved into Mr Colella's ambulance.
She told the panel she had wondered where her colleague had gone after waiting for some time in the ambulance.
"The wife was understandably anxious about what had happened to her husband and was wondering why we weren't leaving to go to hospital," she said.
"He then came back with two full bags of shopping and loaded them in to the front of the ambulance and flippantly said 'do you want to go to hospital then?'.
"Obviously, I wanted to go to hospital some time ago. I waited 20 minutes for Mr Colella while alone in the ambulance," she added.
On another occasion, Mr Colella is alleged to have got a hair cut instead of taking a head injury patient to hospital.
The panel heard Mr Colella, who faces two counts of misconduct, did not turn up at the hearing because he was working.
He has since resigned from the London Ambulance Service.
The hearing continues.

===Input Doc/Src: In total 14 tents were targeted, with cash, mobile phones, electrical items and credit cards stolen.
The incidents took place in the Green Camping Area of the Dundrennan site in the early hours of Sunday.
Police are keen to hear from anyone who may have seen or heard anything suspicious in the area at the time.
However, they praised the public in general for their good behaviour during the event.
Police said said there were "only a few matters of minor disorder" reported and no cases of serious disorder or violence.
There were 46 cases of drug possession and two cases relating to drug supply detected.
Insp Stuart Davidson said:  "We want to thank those who attended the festival for their generally good behaviour, and co-operation with the police and other agencies involved in the security and wellbeing of all those on site over the weekend.
"We have developed good working relationships with the organisers over the years and this experience helped towards a professionally-run event.
"I would also acknowledge the excellent standard of the security and stewards who assisted us over the weekend."

===Input Doc/Src: The NSPCC twice referred Charito Cruz to social services at Kingston Council because of Mohammed Asad Niazi's abuse.
In December Niazi, 30, was found guilty of bludgeoning Ms Cruz to death with a hammer in 2011 and jailed for 12 years.
The council said it was now conducting a "domestic homicide review".
An Ofsted report said the council had not adequately addressed "all the areas identified" in its internal management review, which has never been published but has been seen by BBC London.
Duncan Clark, Kingston's director of children and learning, resigned with a Â£128,000 pay-off the day before the Ofsted report was published.
The internal review found on one occasion a social services manager did not think the referral was serious enough to warrant a home visit.
On the second occasion in September 2011 the manager did not read the referrals but took the documents home to read.
That night, Niazi killed 37-year-old Ms Cruz by hitting her 50 times with a hammer.
The council, Mr Clark and two social work managers criticised in the internal review have refused to comment.
Kingston Council would only say it was conducting a "domestic homicide review" into the case, that new senior managers had been appointed and a "significant investment" had been made.
A council spokesman said: "A number of significant actions have been taken in response to the findings of the Ofsted inspection and the improvement notice in order to improve safeguarding arrangements for children.
"The council is implementing the improvement plan and there is good progress on delivering this agenda."
Kingston's former acting head of social care, Olivia Butler, who ordered the internal investigation into what went wrong, said what she uncovered was "very poor practice and tantamount to negligence".
According to the internal documents, Ms Cruz first emailed children's charity the NSPCC at the beginning of September 2011 as her relationship was breaking down due to Niazi's abuse.

===Input Doc/Src: Scotland was classed as "average" for the first time in a major international study of education.
Meanwhile, the Scottish government is carrying out a major review of school governance.
So just how are schools and the education system run at the moment?
In a nutshell, there is a national school system in Scotland which councils are responsible for delivering.
School buildings are the responsibility of councils - they decide how many schools are needed and where they should be built, open or closed, although they have to observe national rules and guidance.
The system for closing rural schools was overhauled a few years ago. The government also helps fund some new school buildings through its Schools for the Future programme.
Councils also employ teachers and decide how many there should be. However the Scottish government took steps to reverse the long-term decline in teacher numbers across Scotland.
This year, teacher numbers were maintained or rose in 20 of Scotland's 32 council areas.
The most recent funding deal with local government made it plain that the government expected the ratio of teachers to pupils to be maintained. This happened in all but 12 areas.
However, councils are currently responsible for deciding just how much to spend on schools overall - this could be set to change.
The government intends to hold a consultation a "national funding formula" for schools. It also plans to give Â£100m straight to head teachers from next year.
This all fits into a bigger debate about school governance. The question is over just what powers individual head teachers should have, what powers councils should retain and what powers should be given to planned new regional education boards which will work across council boundaries.
The consultation closes on 6 January.
Two national agencies also have important responsibilities - the Scottish Qualifications Authority and Education Scotland.
The SQA is, by far, the better known to the public. Because of its profile, its s

===Input Doc/Src: Saracens - serial winners with a cult-like collective mentality - take on Clermont Auvergne, whose sublime individual talents have too often been big-day bridesmaids.
Often in major finals, the only fireworks on the pitch are when the winning captain lifts the trophy. But both these teams are capable of scintillating rugby to light up Murrayfield.
It will be one to relish.
There is a paradox around this Saracens team.
They have been in the shake-down for major honours for the past five years. Last season, they landed a Premiership-Champions Cup double.
Yet when you read down their teamsheet, it is not the scary set of individual superstars that big-money French sides in particular have put together in this competition's past.
I suspect that is exactly how they like it. Saracens' success has been based around putting the team first.
But that approach can't disguise the fact that fly-half Owen Farrell is fast becoming world class - if he is not there already.
When he initially emerged at Saracens, his game was based on his excellent distribution and dead-eyed place kicking. Now he has so much more.
His passing is sharper, his tactical kicking is more varied, he is a threat when he runs with the ball in hand and, if he doesn't go through a gap himself, he has the sleight of hand to put a team-mate into one.
Opposite him, as in England's narrow Six Nations win over France earlier this year, is Camille Lopez.
Lopez does not have either the flourishes or the fragility you sometimes associate with French fly-halves.
He was excellent in the semi-final win over Leinster, controlling the tempo of the match and minimising mistakes, and if Clermont are to win, Lopez will have to lead them to victory again.
The French side will not be able to outmuscle Saracens. Instead Clermont will have to beat them at their own game, by kicking often and smartly, defending stoutly and backing themselves to be sharper at exploiting the chances when they come.
That puts a lot of pressure on Lop

===Input Doc/Src: Referee Rajindraparsad Seechurn gave Equatorial Guinea a controversial penalty in stoppage time as they beat Tunisia 2-1 in the quarter-finals.
Tunisia staff confronted the official after the match and their federation has been fined $50,000 (£33,000).
"The referees committee noted the poor performance of the referee," the Confederation of African Football said.
Caf added that the referee's failings included an "unacceptable failure to maintain calm and ensure proper control of the players during the match".
Caf also wants an apology from Tunisia for accusations of bias.
And Tunisia have been ordered to pay for damages to a door and a refrigerator in the team's dressing room at Bata Stadium.
Mauritian referee Seechurn awarded the penalty in stoppage time after Ali Maaloul was harshly ruled to have fouled Ivan Bolado when Tunisia were leading 1-0 and, after equalising from the spot through Javier Balboa, hosts Equatorial Guinea went on to win in extra-time.
Seechurn has also been removed from Caf's list of elite referees.
According to Caf, it was sent two letters by the Tunisian FA following the match, with the second asking for an investigation and suggesting that Caf and its officials "were questionable and biased against Tunisia in general".
Unless Tunisia's football federation can provide "irrefutable evidence to substantiate the accusations" they need to send a letter of apology by midnight on 5 February or face expulsion from the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations.
Tunisia football chief Wadie Jary resigned from Caf in protest after the match and he was also "condemned" for his behaviour after going on to the pitch to confront Seechurn, as well as criticising the referee and African football's governing body.
Equatorial Guinea were fined $5,000 (£3,300) for poor security at the stadium.
---Sum/Tgt: An Africa Cup of Nations referee has been banned for six months for "poor performance".

===Input Doc/Src: Maylis de Kerangal is the first French author to win the Â£30,000 award, which honours books of any genre that has a central theme of health or medicine.
It is the first translated text to win and only the second novel to win in the award's history.
Head judge Val McDermid called it "compelling, original and ambitious".
Described as "a heart-breaking and gripping story of life-saving medical science" it follows the story of Simon Limbeau's heart.
He heads out on a surfing trip with two friends but they crash their van on the way home and he is left brain dead but with a beating heart.
His family then face the tough decision whether to donate his heart.
The book depicts the "24-hour whirlwind of trauma and death, life and hope" and ends when the heart starts to beat in the body of someone else.
This year's Chair of Judges, Val McDermid, announced the winner at a ceremony at the Wellcome Collection in London on Monday.
"Mend the Living is a metaphorical and lyrical exploration of the journey of one heart and two bodies," she said.
"Over 24 hours we travel from trauma to hope, discovering both the humane aspect of organ donation and the internal dramas of those affected by it.
"Compelling, original and ambitious, this novel illuminates what it is to be human."
Mend the Living is de Kerangal's fifth novel. She has won previous awards in France for her novel Birth of a Bridge and her novella Tangente vers l'est.
It was translated by Jessica Moore, an award-winning translator, songwriter and poet based in Montreal.
The book has already been adapted into a film by French film director Katell Quillevere, which will open in UK cinemas from 28 April.

===Input Doc/Src: A petrol bomb was thrown at a house at Thornhill Crescent, at about 02:45 BST on Sunday. A man and a woman in the property were not injured.
A window was broken at a property at Cloona Manor just before 00:45 BST and a device was thrown at the front door. It caused minor damage.
It is unclear if anyone was in that house at the time.
A second unexploded petrol bomb was found in the driveway of the house at Cloona Manor. It has been taken away for forensic examination.
The police said they were also investigating  a report of arson at the same property in Thornhill Crescent  at about the same time as the petrol bomb attack.
It was reported that a silver Vauxhall Zafira was set alight in the area.
No-one is believed to have been injured during the arson attack, but the vehicle was extensively damaged.
Ch Insp John Wilson said:  "Enquiries are continuing, but at this stage police are investigating a possible link between an earlier incident that occurred at the Cloona Manor area and the incidents at Thornhill Crescent."
Speaking about the Cloona Manor attack, Sinn FÃ©in MLA Jennifer McCann said: "Attacks like this can lead to serious injury or death and it's very worrying that anyone targeted this elderly man's home in this way.
"If anyone has information on who was behind this attack, then they should give it to the police immediately."
SDLP Lisburn councillor Brian Heading said the Cloona Manor attack was "reckless and dangerous".
"Anybody who throws petrol bombs at a home is attempting murder. There can be no justification of that," he said.
"I'm urging those who carried out the deed to think long and hard and ask themselves what they have achieved and turn themselves into the police."
Police have appealed for witnesses.

===Input Doc/Src: While the City of London tends to grab more headlines, Edinburgh is the UK's second largest financial centre, employing thousands of people in financial services.
Where will banks, investors, brokers, lawyers and accountants choose to ply their trade if the UK were split?
"If in doubt, people may say they don't want to take the risk - they gravitate to London, where more deals can be done," says Prof Ranald Michie of the University of Durham, a financial historian who has studied the City of London for 35 years.
Financial firms have fewer physical constraints to consider compared to a shipyard or a distillery. And they're likely to move to where they can find other companies to provide the advice and services they need, and where they can recruit skilled staff in the greatest abundance, says Prof Michie.
Scottish lender Royal Bank of Scotland has said it will move its legal centre to London in the event of a Yes vote, but has no plans to move jobs.
Banks like RBS already have large offices in London they can simply nominate as their new head office, says Peter Hahn, a former Citigroup banker who is now a senior lecturer at Cass Business School.
"Many of these companies are really run from London anyway."
But for Scotland independence could also create opportunities.
"What has grown up in Edinburgh is fund management and insurance," says Prof Michie. "For them, the gravitational pull of London is much, much less -  Scotland has cheaper rents, cheaper labour. But they have done well tapping business in the UK, so they would need to try to keep that."
Edinburgh could create a business environment to suit its strengths and attract more insurers and asset managers, he says.
"But it will be difficult to stop other cities and financial centres doing the same."
But the City of London stands to gain too in the event of independence, according to Sir Martin Jacomb, former chairman of insurer Prudential and of BZW, Barclays' first foray into investment banking.

===Input Doc/Src: If all over-30s followed recommended guidelines on exercise, nearly 3,000 lives could be saved each year in Australia alone, say researchers.
More needs to be done to warn women of inactivity, as it outweighs other risk factors such as obesity, they say.
Lack of exercise is a known major risk factor for heart disease, says the British Heart Foundation.
A team at the University of Queensland, Australia tracked the health of more than 30,000 women born in the 1920s, 1940s and 1970s.
They found smoking had the greatest impact on women's heart disease risk below the age of 30.
However, as women got older and more gave up smoking, it was overtaken by physical inactivity as the dominant influence on heart disease risk.
Continuing efforts to encourage people to stop smoking were warranted, the researchers reported in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.
But they said greater effort were needed to promote exercise, which they describe as a "Cinderella" risk factor compared with obesity.
"We need a lot more effort to keep middle-aged women active and then keep them active into old age," Prof Wendy Brown, of the university's centre for research on exercise, physical activity and health, told BBC News.
"If you can do at least 30 minutes and preferably 45 minutes a day, you'll see huge improvements in your health and reduce your risk of heart disease by half."
According to NHS Choices, adults aged 19-64 years are recommended to do 150 minutes of weekly physical activity, or 30 minutes on five days a week.
Commenting on the study, Thembi Nkala, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said physical inactivity was a known major risk factor for heart disease.
"Interestingly, this study shows its dominant influence on heart disease amongst women, and suggests a greater need to promote regular physical activity amongst this group," she said.

===Input Doc/Src: The South Stream pipeline, financed by Russia's state gas giant Gazprom, would ship gas to western Europe via the Balkans, thus avoiding Ukraine.
But the European Commission says the pipeline may break EU competition rules and asked Bulgaria to suspend work.
Serbia's prime minister has denied his country has also halted building work.
Reports on Sunday had quoted Serbian ministers as saying the work was on hold until the EU, Russia and Bulgaria resolved their dispute.
But speaking on Monday, Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic said no such decision had been made.
Serbia is in talks with the EU on joining the bloc. Bulgaria is already an EU member state.
Construction work on the South Stream pipeline began in Bulgaria in October 2013.
It is intended to deliver Russian gas to southern Europe without passing through Ukraine and if built, it would deliver 63 billion cubic metres of natural gas a year.
The project was initiated amid disagreements between Gazprom and Ukraine and Belarus over the pricing of Russian gas, which led to gas supplies to some parts of Europe being cut off. It took on added significance following the upheaval in Ukraine.
But the European Commission says Bulgaria may have broken EU public procurement laws by choosing local and Russian bidders for its part of the pipeline, and earlier this month, asked Bulgaria to stop work.
On Monday, Russia's EU envoy Vladimir Chizhov said the move by Brussels was a "creeping shift to economic sanctions against Russia".
"It is hard to shake off the feeling that the European Commission's blocking of the start of work on the construction of Bulgaria's key section of South Stream has been done for purely political purposes," Russia's Itar-Tass news agency quoted him as saying.
Bulgaria has previously said it is being targeted by Brussels as a means of retaliating against Russia over the situation in Ukraine.

===Input Doc/Src: The National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) registered "brief increases" in hate crime reports following attacks at Westminster, Manchester and London Bridge, but not after Finsbury Park.
The incidents were reported to forces in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
NPCC hate crime lead, Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton, said reports "quickly subsided within a few days".
There have been four terror attacks in Britain in 2017 - at Westminster Bridge in London on 22 March, Manchester Arena on 22 May, London Bridge on 3 June and at Finsbury Park in London on 19 June.
Police recorded 234 hate crime incidents two days after the Westminster attack, 273 reports two days after Manchester and 319 reports two days after London Bridge.
Police said in 2016 there were on average 171 hate crimes per day - although this could be higher on weekends, where more hate crimes tended to be reported, or after specific events such as protest marches.
In the week after each attack, hate crime reports increased by 12% after Westminster, 50% after Manchester and 34% after London Bridge.
By contrast, hate crime reports were 7% lower in the week after the Finsbury Park attack, the NPCC said.
Police said race or faith hate crime comprised the vast majority of reports.
But the NPCC added that analysis of the data was "ongoing" and that year-on-year comparisons should be viewed with caution - last year, for example, hate crime reports increased after the EU referendum vote in June.
ACC Hamilton said the figures were nevertheless a "real concern for the police service and wider society".
He said: "We know that terrorist attacks and other national and global events have the potential to trigger short-term spikes in hate crime and so we have been carefully monitoring community tensions following recent horrific events.
"As terrorists seek to divide us, it is more important than ever that we continue to stand united in the face of hostility and hatred."

The home team led 13-0 after 28 minutes thanks to Conor Murray's try and eight points from the boot of Johnny Sexton.
But Wales hit back with Taulupe Faletau's try converted by replacement fly-half Rhys Priestland, whose 72nd-minute penalty edged Wales 16-13 ahead.
Sexton's third penalty squared things and Priestland's late drop-goal attempt was off target in a breathless finale.
With the clock in the red and fans' nerves shredded, both teams strove for the decisive score rather than settle for the draw.
But the defences held out and when referee Jerome Garces finally called a halt, there was a collective exhaling of breath around the ground.
It means Wales have not won back-to-back games in Ireland since 2000, while the Irish dream of a third consecutive title has not been fatally damaged.
But Grand Slams and Triple Crowns will have to wait for another season after a first draw between the two sides in Dublin since 1974.
With Ireland having lost Sean O'Brien and Rob Kearney in the week, Wales had to draft Liam Williams in at full-back after Gareth Anscombe's late withdrawal.
And within 20 minutes replacement fly-half Priestland was on after Dan Biggar limped off with a foot injury.
The Irish dominated the first half hour, with Wales unable to maintain possession and struggling to keep debutant CJ Stander and Tommy O'Donnell in check.
Scrum-half Murray was the beneficiary as he dummied over from close range to help establish a 13-0 lead.
But Priestland's boot, and Faletau's opportunism after the ball squirted out of an advancing scrum, somehow saw Wales back within three points at the break, and the boots of the fly-halves ensured the game ended level after a nerve-shredding second half.
Wales' dominance at the scrum was the cornerstone of their fightback, but Ireland looked more creative behind and with Stander and Jamie Heaslip outstanding in the back row, met Wales' predominantly physical challenge head-on.

===Input Doc/Src: They identified bacteria able to shrug off the drug of last resort - colistin - in patients and livestock in China.
They said that resistance would spread around the world and raised the spectre of untreatable infections.
It is likely resistance emerged after colistin was overused in farm animals.
Bacteria becoming completely resistant to treatment - also known as the antibiotic apocalypse - could plunge medicine back into the dark ages.
Common infections would kill once again, while surgery and cancer therapies, which are reliant on antibiotics, would be under threat.
Chinese scientists identified a new mutation, dubbed the MCR-1 gene, that prevented colistin from killing bacteria.
The report in the Lancet Infectious Diseases showed resistance in a fifth of animals tested, 15% of raw meat samples and in 16 patients.
And the resistance had spread between a range of bacterial strains and species, including E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
There is also evidence that it has spread to Laos and Malaysia.
Prof Timothy Walsh, who collaborated on the study, from the University of Cardiff, told the BBC News website: "All the key players are now in place to make the post-antibiotic world a reality.
"If MCR-1 becomes global, which is a case of when not if, and the gene aligns itself with other antibiotic resistance genes, which is inevitable, then we will have very likely reached the start of the post-antibiotic era.
"At that point if a patient is seriously ill, say with E. coli, then there is virtually nothing you can do."
Resistance to colistin has emerged before.
However, the crucial difference this time is the mutation has arisen in a way that is very easily shared between bacteria.
"The transfer rate of this resistance gene is ridiculously high, that doesn't look good," said Prof Mark Wilcox, from Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust.
His hospital is now dealing with multiple cases "where we're struggling to find an antibiotic" every month - an ev

===Input Doc/Src: Goodwin, who gave Trevor Francis his Blues debut, led the club to two FA Cup semi-finals and promotion to the old Division One in his time in charge, from June 1970 to September 1975.
He had previously been manager of both Scunthorpe United and Brighton.
During his playing career, he was a wing-half for Matt Busby's United, then Leeds before finishing at Scunthorpe.
As one of the Busby Babes, he made his first team breakthrough at Old Trafford following the Munich Air Disaster in 1958.
He played in the first game after Munich, just a fortnight later, when the team-sheet in the programme was famously left blank for the club's FA Cup fifth-round win over Sheffield Wednesday.
And he was in the rebuilt United team all the way to Wembley, where they lost 2-0 to local rivals Bolton Wanderers.
Heywood-born Goodwin also played first-class cricket over two summers, making 11 appearances as a fast bowler for his native Lancashire, in which he took a career-best 5-35 against Middlesex at Lord's in June 1955.
After leaving Birmingham in 1975, Goodwin took up an offer to move to the then burgeoning North American Soccer League, where he had two spells as coach, then club president of the Minnesota Kicks.
He remained in the United States for the rest of his life, and died at home in Gig Harbor, Washington State at the weekend.

===Input Doc/Src: The Celtic left-back was handed the role in Scotland's crucial World Cup qualifier against Slovenia.
And Tierney could continue there against England at Hampden on 10 June.
"It's up to the gaffer, whatever he thinks is best and whatever he thinks the team that is going to give us the best chance of winning," said Tierney.
Scotland had been left short at right-back after Alan Hutton retired from international football and Callum Paterson suffered cruciate ligament damage.
Derby County winger Ikechi Anya had impressed at right-back against England and Canada.
But, as Hull City's Andy Robertson revealed after the 1-0 win over Slovenia, head coach Gordon Strachan decided to move one of his three left-backs over to the left.
Media playback is not supported on this device
Rangers' Lee Wallace missed out through injury, Robertson was chosen on the left and Strachan showed his faith in 19-year-old Tierney for a debut in the right-back role.
"I have been training there all week, so I had a feeling I'd be playing there," said Tierney, who was winning his third Scotland cap.
"The manager and the coaching staff have been giving me pointers. I enjoyed it."
Strachan said before the game that his side needed three points to retain hopes of qualifying for the 2018 finals in Russia.
Instead, the victory moved the Scots two points off second-top Slovakia and gave them a fighting chance of making a play-off.
It was a big occasion for Tierney's Celtic team-mate, Stuart Armstrong, to win his first cap and the midfielder responded by setting up Chris Martin's 88th-minute winning goal four days before his 25th birthday.
Asked about his role in the winner, the former Dundee United player said: "It feels good, but what feels better is to have contributed in a positive way to three points, which we needed to put us in a very good position in the group," he said.

===Input Doc/Src: I've downloaded an episode of David Attenborough's Frozen Planet in about a minute and viewed YouTube videos in the middle of London without a hint of buffering.
I've even tested a live broadcast using nothing but a laptop connected to a mobile phone network. All of this has been thanks to 4G - a technology which is already being rolled out in many parts of the world but won't be widely available in the UK until 2013 at the earliest.
Two big 4G trials are underway at the moment. In London, O2 has launched a test network covering various parts of the centre of town, and soon out to Canary Wharf and the Docklands.
In Cornwall, BT and Everything Everywhere - formerly known as Orange and T-Mobile - have begun testing 4G under very different conditions. The aim there is to work out whether part of the spectrum which is being auctioned late next year will provide a mobile broadband alternative for people who struggle to get a decent service down a fixed line.
Now I can already hear the purists shouting that neither of these trials are "real 4G". Â They will point to the standards set out by the International Telecoms Union for the next generation of mobile networks and claim they do not match up. But I think most people will be more concerned to know what the new services promise - and how soon they will arrive.
In London the O2 trial involves dongles plugged into a computer - there are no 4G handsets available yet. I've tested the network in Soho, where I got speeds of around 35Mbps, and at the O2 in East London, where, surprise surprise, I got something much faster - up to 90Mbps.
So far, these speeds look impressive, although you have to bear in mind that once the new networks are clogged up with thousands of users, they are bound to slow down.
But compared with 3G coverage, which is still annoyingly patchy - as I waited for a train in West London this morning I noticed that my phone was only getting a slow EDGE connection - the 4G revolution promises to make a big dif

===Input Doc/Src: According to a pair of scientific studies, key genes in the immune system come from our ancient "cousins".
The findings, which appear in The American Journal of Human Genetics, suggest we have Neanderthals to thank for being able to fight off pathogens.
But interbreeding may have had a downside, as the same genes may have made us more prone to allergies.
Modern-day people can trace their ancestry to a small population that emerged from Africa about 60,000 years ago.
As the African humans spread out across the world, they came into contact with other ancient humans based in Europe and Western Asia.
Genetic evidence suggests that these different "tribes" interbred, with part of the genome of Neanderthals still present in humans alive today.
About 1% to 6% of the modern Eurasian human genome seems to come from Neanderthals and Denisovans - another extinct member of the human family.
Scientists in Germany analysed the genes of both modern humans and our ancient relatives to find the source of changes in our immune system's genetic blueprints.
They found some of the fragments of Neanderthal DNA in humans alive today play a key role in the immune system as the front line of defence against pathogens such as bacteria, fungi and parasites.
"The evidence suggests that this genetic region contributes to the immune system of modern day humans," Dr Michael Dannemann of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, told BBC News.
"At some point in history it might have been an advantage to have these Neanderthal genes in terms of fighting off infections or lethal pathogens from 10,000 years ago.
"It could also still be an advantage today but this is difficult to pinpoint."
Dr Danneman, a co-researcher on one of the papers, said this inheritance from the Neanderthals could also have left some people more prone to allergies - because of the effect on the immune system - although this needs further investigation in the laboratory.

===Input Doc/Src: About 12 students stormed the offices of LSE director, Sir Howard Davies Students and 150 held a rally outside.
The LSE says it is reconsidering links with Libya "as a matter of urgency".
But the students demanded the university paid back the £300,000 it had accepted of a £1.5m grant from a charity wing of the regime.
The grant was pledged in 2009 by the Gaddafi International Charity and Development Foundation.
The funds have so far been used to develop a research programme on North Africa, focused on politics, economics and society.
The student demonstrators called on the LSE management to "repay" the £300,000 already spent by creating a scholarship fund for underprivileged Libyan students.
The students also urged the university to revoke the LSE alumni status of Libyan leader Col Gaddafi's second son Saif al-Islam, who studied at the university from 2003 to 2008, gaining both a Master of Science degree and a doctorate.
They called for a public commitment that no grants from officials "of such oppressive regimes" would be accepted in the future, as well as a public statement  denouncing the recent "gross violations of human rights" by the Gaddafi regime.
One of the protesters, Ashok Kumar, who is also education officer for the LSE students' union, said: "I think it's reprehensible that the university continues to benefit from money that was stolen from the Libyan people and it's only right to return it to the people who are now being murdered in the streets fighting for their freedom."
The money should be returned either as scholarships to underprivileged students, or "to the families of those who have been murdered and who continue to be murdered", he said.
In a statement, the university said the LSE Director "noted the message" from the  students.

The team from the Canada-France Hawaii Telescope inferred the dark matter's existence by the way it bends light.
The images were presented at the 219th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Austin, US.
The four images were taken at four different seasons of the year, each capturing a swath of the sky about as large as a palm held at arm's length.
They are a big step forward in understanding both dark matter itself, and the means by which dark matter influences the way normal matter clumps into the galaxies we see in the night skies.
Together, they represent the images of more than 10 million galaxies, whose light gives the only hints of the large-scale structure of dark matter.

"Light coming toward us from a distant galaxy is bent by the gravity of a lump of matter in the middle," explained Catherine Heymans of the University of Edinburgh.
"Einstein's theory of general relativity tells us that mass bends space and time, so when light comes toward us through the Universe, if it passes some dark matter, its light gets bent and the image we see gets bent and distorted," Dr Heymans told the meeting.
"Dark matter is leaving its signature on the images of very distant galaxies."
The survey is some 100 times larger than the previous largest map of the web of dark matter, gathered by the Hubble telescope's Cosmic Evolution Survey, or Cosmos.
In the new image, the full-scale distribution of vast clumps of dark matter can be seen around galaxy clusters, connected by wispy filaments of dark matter and trailing off to enormous voids where no matter exists.

The specialist unit will provide parts for aero-engines which have gone out of volume production, meaning it requires flexible skills in making bespoke items.
It is expected that 130 roles will be created.
The company said this would partly offset the loss of almost 190 jobs announced in March.
While Rolls-Royce has faced big challenges in adjusting to market changes, with repeated profit warnings, it is consolidating its operations.
It currently has 54,000 employees in more than 50 countries, making and servicing aero-engines for airlines, ships and military use. Last year, it had turnover of more than £14bn.
Mike Mosley, chief operating officer for the supply chain division at the Derby-based firm, said: "Our investment in Inchinnan demonstrates our commitment to innovative technology and world-class facilities which will improve performance and drive profitable growth for our business.
"We recognise the dedication and flexibility of the Inchinnan workforce who continue to play a key role in the success of Rolls-Royce."
Rolls-Royce initially invested £85m in the Inchinnan plant.
In a statement, the company said the investment would "potentially" offset the impact of job reductions announced earlier this year as part of the restructuring of its aerospace division.
Renfrewshire Council said the investment was a "vote of confidence" in the Inchinnan plant.
Council leader Mark Macmillan added: "For a world-leading manufacturer to choose Renfrewshire as a focus for further investment is also a tremendous boost for the Renfrewshire economy.
"Renfrewshire has a proud engineering and manufacturing heritage and Rolls-Royce has been at the forefront of that."

He also said he would vote to leave the EU to avoid being "dominated and bullied by the Germans".
The firm has committed £1bn to 100 new products over four years.
"Export is vital for Britain to create wealth," said founder and chairman James Dyson. "In order to export you have to have high technology products that are better than those produced elsewhere in the world."
To boost UK research and development, engineers who come to study in UK universities should be encouraged to work in the UK after their course has finished, Mr Dyson said.
"One important thing we should do is to keep those engineers in Britain. A lot of them come from overseas, in fact, 90% of researchers at British universities come from overseas, and we must encourage them to stay here."
"I would change our immigration laws to allow the right sort of people to stay here," he said.
In addition, Mr Dyson said he didn't particularly want to stay in the EU.
"I think it's a European Union dominated by Germany, and in our particular field we have these very large German companies who dominate standards setting and energy reduction committees, and so we get the old guard and old technology supported and not new technology.
"I want to keep EFTA - European free trade - and free movement of peoples, but I don't see that we need to be dominated and bullied by the Germans."

Work is set to begin on the Â£21m project at the end of the 2015 season.
The redevelopment must first be approved by the club's membership, with the committee set to seek approval at a special general meeting in the summer of 2015.

On Friday, Mr Carson reiterated his views about gun control.
"Basically, what I said is when tyranny occurs traditionally around the world, they try to disarm the people first," Mr Carson told the National Press Club in Washington.
The retired neurosurgeon drew condemnation last month for saying a Muslim should not run for president because Islam was inconsistent with the US constitution.
On Friday, he compared his view to the constitutional requirement that a president be a natural-born citizen.
America's founders, he said, didn't "even want to take the slightest chance to put someone in that position who had divided loyalties".
After a week of uttering one controversial remark after another, many of which made US headlines, Ben Carson gave a lunchtime address in the proverbial lion's den - the National Press Club in Washington.
Early in his speech, he acknowledged what everybody in the audience already knew.
"I'm not politically correct," he said. "And that's one of the reason why some of the people in the press don't like me. But it's OK. What I really love is this country. I don't really care if the press likes me or not."

The corporation said it was "part of the News Channel function to be there when major stories take place".
Another 34 complaints were received from people upset that the service had been interrupted.
Live coverage of the service began at 17:00 GMT and continued until just before 20:30 GMT, with the BBC continuing to report on the story afterwards.
"The News Channel's coverage of Whitney Houston's funeral reflected the significant interest in her sudden death as well as acknowledging the impact she had as a global recording artist," said the corporation in a statement.
It acknowledged that "some people felt there was too much coverage" but said BBC One's teatime bulletin, radio bulletins and other services had still given viewers "the best access to the day's other news stories".
Stevie Wonder, Alicia Keys and R Kelly performed at the service, which took place in Newark, New Jersey. Actor Kevin Costner, who starred with Houston in The Bodyguard, gave a eulogy.
The 48-year-old singer was found in a bath in her hotel room at the Beverly Hilton in Los Angeles on 11 February.
The cause of her death will remain unclear until the results of the toxicology tests are announced.

===Input Doc/Src: Researchers found residues of potassium bromate and potassium iodate in 84% of the samples collected from Delhi.
The chemicals are banned in many countries, but India continues to allow their use in bakeries.
The All India Bread Manufacturers' Association said the chemicals were "considered safe".
Health Minister JP Nadda has urged people  not to panic and to wait for his ministry's report on the issue.
"I have told my officials to report to me on an urgent basis. There is no need to panic. Very soon we will come out with the [inquiry] report," he said.
Delhi-based environmental think-tank Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) said in its report that it had collected 38 bread and bakery samples from retail stores, bakeries and fast-food shops in Delhi for its study.
"More than 84% of samples tested were found to contain potassium bromate and/or iodate," it said.
The CSE has urged the government to ban the use of these chemicals in bakery products.
"Considering that it [potassium bromate] can cause cancer, is banned in most parts of the world, and has healthy alternatives, there is no reason why this chemical should be allowed, specifically when residues are found to be present in the end-product."
The CSE said potassium iodate should also be banned because "it can potentially affect the functioning of thyroid".
The bread manufacturers' association said it was yet to see the CSE report, but added that the two additives were safe and "widely used in advanced countries like the US".
"Food Safety and Standards Authority of India's regulations permit the use of potassium bromate and/or potassium iodate at 50 ppm max for bread and at 20 ppm max for bakery purpose," the association said in a statement.
---Sum/Tgt: India's health ministry has ordered an inquiry after a study found cancer-causing chemicals in many bread and other bakery products.

Leicester's Selby, runner-up in 2007, was 10-5 behind but won 10 of the next 12 frames for a 15-12 lead.
Five-time champion O'Sullivan, who had never lost a world final, reduced the deficit to 15-14, only for Selby to win the next three frames.

Ranking titles: World Championship 2014, UK Championship 2012, Shanghai Masters 2011, Welsh Open 2008

His victory means he returns to the top of the world rankings and leaves O'Sullivan two behind Stephen Hendry's record tally of seven world titles.
Selby dedicated his win to his late father, who died when he was 16.
"To beat Ronnie in the final to win my first world title is a dream come true," he added:
O'Sullivan said: "I tried my hardest but he was just too good,"
Selby, 30, is £300,000 richer for his Crucible triumph and is the ninth player to win the Triple Crown, having won three Masters titles and a UK Championship.
Selby looked jaded on Sunday following his epic semi-final against Neil Robertson but managed to win the final two frames to stay within three of O'Sullivan, who wrapped up his last-four encounter against Barry Hawkins with a session to spare.
He then won five of the six frames in Monday's opening session to drag his rival into unfamiliar territory, O'Sullivan having never before trailed heading into the final session of a Crucible final.
Selby made breaks of 55, 52 and 74 - his highest of the match so far - to level the contest at 10-10 before winning a tense 21st frame to lead for the first time.
O'Sullivan retook the lead after the mid-session interval, winning an error-strewn frame courtesy of a run of 50, but missed a simple pink into the middle pocket to clinch the frame after deciding to play it with pace.
Selby duly cleared up before punching the air and ramming his cue into the ground in a mixture of relief and elation.

Rangers parted company with former boss Mark Warburton earlier this month.
"I don't think there's anybody in a job or out of a job that wouldn't want to take that call," said Wright.
"Yeah, I would speak [if the call came in from Rangers] because it's a big club but it's all hypothetical.
"That call hasn't happened as from other clubs it hasn't happened so I'm still happy here."
Wright and Aberdeen counterpart Derek McInnes are the Scottish Premiership managers that have been linked with Rangers since Warburton's departure.
Former Ibrox boss Alex McLeish and ex-Rangers defender Frank de Boer have also been mentioned in connection with the post.
Rangers have reportedly held interviews to fill both the manager's job and a director of football post.

American Vandeweghe, 25, faces a last-eight meeting with Spain's French Open champion Garbine Muguruza, who beat Romanian Sorana Cirstea 6-2 6-3.
Venus Williams also progressed, beating Germany's Mona Barthel.
The 36-year-old seven-time Grand Slam champion - the oldest player in the women's singles - won 6-3 7-5 and will take on  Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, who beat fellow Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova 6-3 6-3.
Vandeweghe's victory was her first against a world number one and takes her to a Grand Slam quarter-final for the second time in her career, after reaching the last eight at Wimbledon in 2015.
It meant the top seed from the women's and men's draws both left the competition on day seven, after Andy Murray's shock defeat by Germany's world number 50 Mischa Zverev.
Vandeweghe had Kerber on the defensive for much of their 68-minute contest, closing out the first set with ease after breaking in the sixth game.
And even though Kerber was able to break immediately in the second set, Vandeweghe won four successive games from 3-2 down for the biggest win of her career.
"It was really special," she said. "Beating the world number one on any stage and any place is great. I'll take this one.
"I wasn't feeling confident - I guess I faked it. I was nervous, but I had a game plan to execute and I knew that as along as I kept picking my spots, I had a chance."
It is 19 years since Venus Williams reached her first Australian Open quarter-final, and 14 years since her one and only final, when she lost to her sister Serena.

===Input Doc/Src: The company's decision last week to grant the equivalent of a 50% pay rise to six top executives sparked outrage.
Quebec's government agreed to a CA$1.34bn ($1bn; Â£800m) bailout in 2016, a year after it teetered on the edge of bankruptcy.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he was "not pleased" with the pay hike.
But he welcomed the change of heart.
Protesters gathered outside the firm's headquarters in Montreal on Sunday, hours before Bombardier relented and said the rises would be deferred to 2020.
They will be payable only if the firm achieved performance goals, it said.
"Over the past 75 years, our fellow citizens have always been by our side," said Bombardier chief executive Alain Bellemare on Sunday night.
"It is because of this deep relationship that we are sensitive to the public reaction to our executive compensation practices."
He was one of the six executives who were set to receive payments of CA$43.7m ($32.6m; Â£26.1m) in 2016.
That was up from CA$30m the year before, according to regulatory filings.
Bombardier originally justified the pay increases as a necessary measure to retain top talent.
But two Quebec cabinet ministers pressured the company last week to heed the backlash.
The Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard tweeted that he was "satisfied" with Sunday's climb-down by the firm.
The Quebec government last year invested CA$1.34bn in Bombardier's C-Series aircraft programme in return for a nearly 50% stake.
In February, the federal government agreed to give the company CA$372.5m in interest-free loans.
In 2016, Bombardier also announced lay-offs for 14,500 people, including about 20% of its workforce in Belfast.
The redundancies came as the firm secured orders with Delta Air Lines and Air Canada and made its maiden commercial voyage with Swiss Air Lines.

===Input Doc/Src: The Ministry of Public Security said 1,168 cultural relics worth more than 500m yuan ($80m; £52m) had been found.
The artefacts are thought to be illegally excavated in Niuheliang, a Neolithic archaeological site in north-eastern Liaoning province.
The ministry said the activities of the looters had severely damaged the site.
Among the artefacts was a coiled jade dragon, one of the earliest known depictions of the mythological creature, authorities said.
Unesco says the Niuheliang archaeological site, which dates back 5,500-5,000 years, was a burial and sacrificial centre in the late Hongshan period.
State media described the recovery as the biggest operation of its kind since the founding of modern China in 1949.
The date of the recovery operation was not provided, but the ministry said in a statement that 1,000 police officer were involved.
The looters were said to be split into 10 gangs that were responsible for everything from the excavation to the selling of the relics, according to China Daily.
Four archaeologists are also thought to be involved, the newspaper said.
"Artefacts are sold at a fast speed and traded frequently in a short time," said Cai Binghui, a police officer who was involved with the case according to China Daily.

The city council said rebuilding would be too expensive and the venue would be sold to a private company and could be knocked down and the site redeveloped.
As well as live music, the Assembly Rooms also hosted British Open snooker.
Perhaps its most famous musical moment was in 1983, when Morrissey was hit in the eye with a flower during a Smiths gig and fans invaded the stage at the end.
The venue also hosted performances from acts such as The Clash, Paul Weller and Manic Street Preachers and was home to the city's pantomime each year.
City council Labour leader Ranjit Banwait said he hoped the venue would be replaced with "some kind of cultural offer".
The opposition Conservative group said the local authority had dithered over the plans.
Councillor Robin Wood said the venue could have been kept "alive" in the interim until a bidder was found.
He said: "For over a year now we have been wondering what on earth is going to happen. Now we are told the wrecking ball is going to go at it.
"I think it would be much better to refurbish it and reopen it and look at other alternatives. What we will end up with is a pile of rubble and nothing."
Dave Parry, of the Derby Civic Society, said the venue was too big for the market place and never really achieved what it set out to do.

It started selling Lloyds shares in 2013, and the latest sale means it has now raised more than £8bn.
Last weekend, David Cameron said the Conservatives would offer up to £4bn of Lloyds shares to private investors if he won the general election.
The prime minister said it would "help us recover billions more to pay down the national debt". The Labour party said the Tories had announced the plans several times before.
In the latest sale, the government sold 742 million shares which, at Thursday's closing price, would have raised £586m for the Treasury. The actual total may be slightly lower as the government would have sold its shares throughout the day, during which Lloyds shares rose steadily in the afternoon to hit a closing high of 78.99 pence.
The sale means the government's shareholding has been reduced by another 1%, and is now down to 20.95%.
"Today's announcement shows the further progress made in returning Lloyds Banking Group to full private ownership and enabling the taxpayer to get their money back," a statement from Lloyds said.

===Input Doc/Src: Archaeologists made the discovery at Tresness in Sanday while on a walk in poor weather on Monday.
The remains of 14 houses and stone tools, including knives, have been described as "one of the biggest complexes of Bronze Age settlement in the Scottish isles".
The finds on the beach could be more than 4,000 years old.
Archaeologists believe the houses were buried by sand dunes in the second millennium BC - but have recently been exposed by the actions of weather and the sea.
Prof Jane Downes and Christopher Gee, of the University of the Highlands and Islands, Prof Colin Richards, of the University of Manchester and Dr Vicki Cummings, of University of Central Lancashire, made the discovery.
They were on a sea shore walk to visit a known archaeological site when they spotted the remains of the houses and stone tools.
Prof Downes, who specialises in the Bronze Age, said: "This must be one of the biggest complexes of Bronze Age settlement in the Scottish isles, rivalling the spreads of hut circles in other parts of mainland Scotland."
The scale of the Sanday has been described as "unparalleled in Orkney". The islands are well-known for the Skara Brae Neolithic settlement.
Cath Parker, leader of the Sanday Archaeology Group, said: "This is incredibly exciting.
"The archaeological landscape concealed beneath Sanday's  shifting sands never ceases to amaze us.
"I'm sure the local community will relish the opportunity to be involved with any work which stems from this thrilling discovery."
Important Bronze Age discoveries have been made in recent years in other parts of Scotland.

Mr Sandford's mother Lynne, who was not in court for the hearing, wants him to return to the UK for psychiatric help.
Prosecutors allege Mr Sandford, 20, tried to grab a police officer's gun to shoot Republican presidential candidate Mr Trump at a campaign rally in Las Vegas on 18 June.

The year-long review will also consider the breadth of the home secretary's discretion to intervene in cases.
It follows a series of high-profile cases, including that of computer hacker Gary McKinnon.
The Home Office says the current extradition arrangements will continue and the review will not impact on any cases currently under consideration.
The review panel, led by a retired Law Lord, is expected to be finished by the end of summer 2011.
Former Home Secretary David Blunkett, who signed the treaty, accused the current Home Secretary Theresa May of kicking the controversy "into the long grass".
Recently, he admitted he might have "given too much away" to the Americans and said sensible discussions with the UK's partners could resolve "any irritants quite speedily".
The review will consider the operation of the Extradition Act 2003, including the European arrest warrant, and the US/UK extradition treaty.
Home Secretary Theresa May said: "I am fully aware there are a number of areas of the UK's extradition arrangements which have attracted controversy in recent years.
"This government is committed to reviewing those arrangements to ensure they work both efficiently and in the interests of justice."
The European arrest warrant fast-tracks extradition between EU member states.
It means countries can ask for extradition of an individual without providing prima-facie evidence to the courts, usually as long as the offence is a crime in both countries and carries a prison sentence of more than one year.

Officials says more than 1.4 million people urgently need humanitarian help.
There are also fears of a cholera outbreak, with spikes in cases and deaths reported in the south west.
The waterborne disease reached the island via Nepalese UN troops after the deadly earthquake in 2010, causing the deaths of nearly 10,000 people.
Tensions have been high as help has yet to reach many families whose crops and water supplies have been destroyed.
Haitian police and UN peacekeepers used tear gas to disperse a group of 100 residents who attacked humanitarian convoys in Les Cayes on Saturday.
"We understand the impatience and the anger of the population who are waiting for emergency relief. We are doing all we can to facilitate the arrival of the assistance soon as possible," Mr Ban said.
He flew over areas hit by the hurricane alongside Prime Minister Enex Jean-Charles.
"I was very, very sad when we saw the complete devastation. But people the world over stand with you," the UN chief added.
"We are going to mobilize as many resources and as much medical support as we can to first of all stop the cholera epidemic and second support the families of the victims."
Some 120,000 homes were either damaged or destroyed when Category Four Hurricane Matthew swept through on 4 October with winds of 145mph (230km/h).

===Input Doc/Src: A freedom of information request by Plaid Cymru revealed the Labour-run authority had paid out £144,000 for the legal costs of nursery campaigners.
It also paid the £97,500 legal bill of successful library campaigners.
The council said costs in such circumstances usually fell on the authority which was "regrettable".
RCT had previously revealed that its own external legal costs came to £113,199.
Parents took their fight to the High Court in May to overturn the council's decision to end full-time nursery education for younger children.
Meanwhile, in the same month, campaigners chained themselves to bookshelves to protest against the proposed closure of Rhydfelin library.
They were granted a judicial review before it was reprieved.
Plaid Cymru said the money would have been better spent on frontline services.
It said the council had tried to "railroad" local people and it had been "a very expensive mistake to make".
A council spokesman said due to continued UK government cuts unpopular decisions had to be made.
"As is their right, residents can and have challenged these particular council decisions which, in respect of the decision to make changes to the funding arrangements for nursery education, resulted in the council's decision being quashed."
---Sum/Tgt: Rhondda Cynon Taf Council (RCT) has had to pay a £350,000 legal bill over challenges to cuts in nursery education and Rhydyfelin library's closure.

===Input Doc/Src: James Calveley Evans, 33, from Maes Pennant, Mostyn, Flintshire, appeared at Mold Crown Court on Friday.
He also pleaded guilty to three charges of distributing child sex images and three charges of possessing child sex images.
He has been further remanded in custody pending a pre-sentence report and will be sentenced in September.
Evans, who has been suspended as a North Wales Police constable, thought he was corresponding with a child by email, but it was an undercover police officer.
He admitted to the court he had attempted to arrange or facilitate a child sex offence in February.
But he denied a second similar offence in March, which the prosecution had agreed to lie on file.
Evans was also found to be downloading and distributing child sex abuse images and was found to have 607 photographs and 16 video images.
Judge Rhys Rowlands told him custody was inevitable and that it would "simply be a matter of the length of the sentence".

===Input Doc/Src: That was better than the 3% pace that economists had been expecting and follows the 4.6% growth rate recorded in the April-June quarter.
Strong export growth and higher government spending helped to boost growth in the third quarter.
In a sign of confidence in the US recovery, on Wednesday the Federal Reserve ended its stimulus scheme.
The fall in the unemployment rate to a six-year low has helped to boost that confidence.
"Today's number represents a return to a healthy-looking trend. The most recent IMF forecasts suggest the US economy will grow 3.1% next year and 3.0% in 2016, and these could be revised further upwards in the coming months," said Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown stockbrokers.
The report was the first of three estimates of gross domestic product, so the figure could be revised up or down, over the coming months.
Growth was lifted in the third quarter by a sharp increase in government spending, which itself was boosted by a surge in defence expenditure.
Exports were another area of strength, they rose at an annual rate of 7.8%.
But there will be a question over whether that pace can be maintained as important export markets for the US are struggling.
Growth in many European countries is stagnant and the Chinese economy is slowing down.
Consumption growth was relatively weak in the third quarter, running at an annual rate of 1.8%, but economists expect that to improve.
"Conditions are in place for a pick-up in the pace of consumption growth," said Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics.
"Real personal disposable incomes increased by a healthy 2.7% in the third quarter and, with the prospect of further big gains in employment and the impact of the slump in energy prices, real incomes should enjoy an even bigger gain in the fourth quarter."
Overall it has been a volatile year for US growth data.
In the first quarter the economy contracted at an annual rate of 2.1% after severe weather hampered economic activity.

Phytophthora ramorum is a fungus-like pathogen that can kill or severely damage larch trees.
Forest Enterprise Scotland (FES) is also asking woodland visitors to help prevent the spread of tree disease.
It called on people to brush mud and forest debris from boots, walking poles and bike tyres when leaving and entering wooded areas.
All the new sites are close to existing infected sites.
FES confirmed the locations as:
Fraser McDonald, a forester with the FES team in Cowal said: "Everyone has a part to play in helping prevent the spread of tree diseases and it's simply a matter of making sure that you arrive at a forest with clean boots, bike wheels - and even dog's paws.
"Our Keep it Clean campaign promotes good biosecurity practice and explains that it only takes a few minutes to brush off any mud or forest debris from boots, walking poles or bike tyres.
"It may not seem much but tree diseases can be carried from site to site in mud or on twigs leaves and others forest debris, so those few minutes can make a big difference."
Mr McDonald said Scotland's forestry was a valuable resource for recreation and the economy of Scotland.
He added: "It's important that everyone does there bit to look after Scotland's forests and help to prevent the spread of tree diseases."

===Input Doc/Src: Senna's family sent a helmet used by the three-time champion in 1987 to give to Hamilton when he earned a 65th pole, which he did in Canada on Saturday.
"It is the most special thing I have, beyond all trophies," said Hamilton.
"As I kid I thought maybe one day I can get to Formula 1 and emulate Ayrton. To equal him; I just can't believe it."
Hamilton has long since surpassed Senna's record of 41 wins - he did so at the 2015 Japanese Grand Prix - and now has 55.
In both poles and wins, he now lags behind only seven-time champion Michael Schumacher, who claimed 68 poles and 91 victories.
Asked whether surpassing Senna's marks meant more than Schumacher's, Hamilton said: "I haven't got to the 68 of Michael so I can't really say. I can't look that far ahead at the moment.
"Ayrton was the guy I noticed from the beginning. I think it was the colour of the helmet. So I am honoured to be honoured by that family.
"To think that I am that close to Michael's record is incredible - I plan on getting there but that is all ifs and buts."
Hamilton, who repeatedly looked at Senna's helmet as he sat in the post-qualifying news conference, said the achievement was even more special given it happened at one of his favourite races - where he claimed his first pole and win back in his debut season of 2007.
"I knew 65 was there and waiting; I knew Montreal has been a beautiful place for me," he said. "I thought if I was going to get that special pole anywhere, it was going to be here.
"But you can only hope it is going to go well, and often it doesn't.
"The lap started perfectly, very smooth, no mistakes, built it up and then the last corner which has always been a strength of mine."
He added: "I am honoured to be among those great drivers, the legends. Ultimately just very proud.
"It wouldn't be possible without all the work from my family.
"This is just the tip of the iceberg. No-one knows how hard we worked to get here. I am proud to have got the Hamilton name here. If this was my la

===Input Doc/Src: The bond, which will pay a fixed gross rate of interest of 6.50% a year until 2022, was on sale from 24 April to 6 May.
David Armstrong, the club's chief executive, said the response had been "very positive" and offered stability for the club's future.
Wasps play in the Aviva Premiership at the Ricoh Arena in Coventry.
The club moved to the 32,600-seater stadium from Adams Park, High Wycombe, in December 2014.
"The funds raised [from bond sales] will enable us to restructure our balance sheet and pay down our existing debt, including the loans we acquired with the Ricoh Arena," Mr Armstrong said.
"We now have a solid foundation for the long-term future of the club and look forward to the future with confidence."
Minimum initial investment in the bond was £2,000 - which, like any investment, has risks involved. There are plans for it to be tradable on the London Stock Exchange's Order Book for Retail Bonds.
The bonds will be guaranteed by the two key operating companies, Wasps Holdings and Arena Coventry Ltd, including the Ricoh Arena.
Interest will be paid on 13 November and 13 May in each year with the investment due to be paid back in full on 13 May, 2022. Trading in the bonds is earmarked to start on 14 May.

===Input Doc/Src: Neville, a former Manchester United and Everton player, was criticised for his lack of emotion and "monotone" style.
In response, Neville told BBC Radio 5 live the TV role was "a lot harder than I thought it was going to be".
Despite the complaints, the BBC said the footballer would continue to play "a key role throughout the tournament".
A spokesperson added Neville - who is currently a coach for Manchester United and has received broadcast training - was "an important, well-respected member of our team".
Neville told sports presenter Mark Chapman he welcomed the feedback on his performance: "In terms of the content I got out, I thought [it] was quite good.
"But the feedback is that I need to show a bit more excitement, so I think you'll see that more on Thursday night in the highlights show.
"I will get better - it was my first live gig and I'm just glad I helped everyone get to sleep back home!"
The England v Italy match attracted an average 11.5 million viewers, peaking at 15.6 million just before half-time making it one of the most watched programmes of the year so far.
Viewers also took to Twitter to criticise Neville, with several joking England physio Gary Lewin - who was stretchered off after injuring his ankle - had "fallen into a coma" listening to him.
Neville responded saying: "1st live co-comm last night - sometimes u have to take the criticism - it will only make me better- thanks for the feedback (ahhahaha)!"
BBC Radio 5 live broadcaster Danny Baker was among his critics but said the BBC should share the blame.
"Phil Neville has acknowledged he wasn't great during England commentary - but what were the BBC doing giving him that game to 'learn his craft'?" he said.

Birmingham-based One Dance UK will receive the highest investment of £3m, while British Ceramics Biennial in Stoke-on-Trent will receive £700,000.
In a move to fund more regional organisations, 25 new groups will receive funding between 2018 and 2022.
Some organisations have faced cuts to their funding but none have lost out completely.
The Royal Shakespeare Company has lost 3% of their previous investment but will still be granted just under £60m.
The Arts Council said in a statement it is pleased to be investing in projects that "will benefit local people".
The region will see an overall increase in spending of 8% with the annual sum paid to arts organisations rising from £49.6m to £53.5m.
The Lapworth Museum in Birmingham is one of the new organisations to benefit and has been granted £418, 984.
Director Jon Clatworthy said it's been a "fantastic year" for the museum which has just celebrated one year since its reopening as well as a nomination for Museum of the Year.

===Input Doc/Src: A new report said the gap between the hourly earnings of the two sexes widens after women become mothers.
Their hourly pay rate falls 33% behind men's over a 12-year period, it added.
But in Northern Ireland, there is an established trend of women earning more than men.
In 2010, typical (median) female full-time hourly earnings, excluding overtime, in Northern Ireland moved slightly ahead of male earnings for the first time.
That has continued over the last five years, except for 2012 when typical female and male full-time hourly earnings were the same.
In 2015, typical female full-time hourly earnings, excluding overtime, were 101% of male earnings compared to a ratio of 91% for the UK as a whole.
The pattern of women earning slightly more than men is not uniform across the income distribution.
Men have higher earnings in the 90th percentile (among the top 10% of earners), and at the 40th percentile and below.
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has suggested that the gap in favour of full-time female workers overall is partly to do with a higher proportion of public sector jobs in Northern Ireland than in the rest of the UK.
There are more women employed in this sector than men and these jobs tend to be higher paid, in general, than in the private sector.
At a wider, all-employee level, there is still a gap in favour of men because there are more full-time male employees.
All of the above data is from the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings.

===Input Doc/Src: The Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead is one of the first councils in England to launch a PledgeBank.
The pledges, from cleaning graffiti to organising a street party, can only be undertaken if other residents commit to the idea.
The Conservative council said the scheme helps it save money but also "results in a better social outcome".
Once a pledge is made, the council will check it fits the set criteria and then publish it online.
It comes after a failed Big Society scheme to get residents to donate savings in their council tax, which the council has cut for the past four years.
George Bathurst, cabinet member for policy and performance, said other schemes such as Green Redeem recycling rewards were a success.
He said: "No one wants to just hand over a cheque but everybody would like to do something for their community."
Mr Bathurst will make the first pledge to donate five Christmas food items to FoodBank if 10 other local people will do the same by 18 December.
Fiona Dent, Windsor's Labour candidate, said: "Volunteering creates strong bonds between people, reinforces their ideals and can provide the help people need in difficult times.
"However, we are living through difficult times now. Most people in the middle and lower incomes are a lot worse off than they were five years ago and they may well have more than one job to help pay the bills, leaving less time for volunteer activities."

===Input Doc/Src: It said the scale of footpath erosion was "threatening Snowdonia's fragile nature".
The number of walkers climbing Snowdon has doubled since 2007 and more than four million people visited Snowdonia last year.
But the trust said grass species move in when pathways are eroded, strangling some plants.
Rhys Thomas, National Trust ranger for Snowdonia, said: "I've been building and rebuilding paths in the area for eight years.
"It's tiring, time-consuming and back-breaking work - involving hundreds of hours of volunteer time which requires shifting tonnes of stone by hand, vehicle and helicopter.
"But it's vital if we want to protect the delicate upland habitats that make Snowdonia a special place for wildlife."
Plants which could be at risk include purple saxifrage, moss campion and roseroot.
It is also home to the endangered Snowdon beetle - which in the UK are only found in Snowdonia.
The trust is trying to raise Â£250,000 to repair two-and-a-half miles of path.
It comes as concerns grow over the amount of litter being left on Snowdon, with some calling for a walker's charge to be introduced.
The appeal is supported by Hollywood actor Matthew Rhys, National Trust Wales's Snowdonia Ambassador.
Mr Rhys, who is from Cardiff, but has strong family connections to the national park, said he had seen the "trail of destruction left by the eroded paths" during visits to the area.
"There's a delicate balance to be struck between man and nature," he added.

"She's seen them so many times," Ms Stuart said.
"It's really given Leah something to aim for and really look forward to once she's recovered."
The campaign has received thousands of retweets.

She said the message "would make Leah's day and aid her recovery".
She added her friend had tickets to see the band in concert in Cardiff on Saturday but was unable to go because of her injuries.
The band are currently in Europe as part of a world tour.

===Input Doc/Src: Thomas Condliff, who weighs 22 stone (140kg) and has type 2 diabetes, is challenging a decision to refuse him a gastric bypass operation.
NHS North Staffordshire says he does not meet its criteria for weight loss surgery.
Decisions about exceptional funding are based on medical factors alone.
Mr Condliff, 62, was initially refused funding for a gastric bypass operation because his weight/height ratio (Body Mass Index) fell below the threshold set by his local primary care trust.
At 22 stone his Body Mass Index (BMI) is about 43, but in North Staffordshire only patients with a BMI over 50 are routinely treated with weight loss surgery.  A decision to refuse him funding as an exceptional case was upheld in an earlier court hearing.
Now Mr Condliff is taking his legal battle to the Court of Appeal in a case that has implications for many other areas.
NHS North Staffordshire makes its decisions for exceptional funding on the medical condition of the patient, and rules out considering their personal circumstances.
As a result of his diabetes Tom Condliff has lost the sight in one eye, and he also has kidney problems. He can no longer stand or walk for more than a short time and relies on his wife, Lana, to help him wash and dress.
He says that during his legal battle his quality of life has worsened, and even an extremely calorie-restricted diet has failed to help him lose weight.
"I've been given about a year to live by one of the specialists. I feel more and more poorly each day, my diabetes is way out of control."
Having failed to overturn the initial decision to refuse a gastric bypass, he is now resting his hopes on asking the courts to compel the NHS to take into account the impact on his life and that of his family.
"My wife barely goes out, because she doesn't want to leave me. It's awful just being locked indoors. It doesn't matter where you live, how nice it is, it's still a cage. "

City dominated a scoreless first half against Reading but had to wait until Beattie's second-half header to lead.
Houghton's classy late free-kick found the bottom corner to make it 2-0.
The victory was well deserved but the visitors restricted City's opportunities in the first period, with Jane Ross going closest when her shot hit the bar.
However, Beattie eased any fears of dropping points when she converted Toni Duggan's free-kick soon after the restart, and fellow centre-back Houghton wrapped up victory with two minutes remaining.
City have three league matches left, including one against Chelsea. Even if they lose to the London side, City need only two wins to be certain of clinching the league title.

"I know the feeling of having won the league and I want that to happen with this club. It's a brilliant club and we want titles, and we want silverware. Hopefully experience will help.

The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were given a tour of the school before unveiling a plaque watched by its 122 pupils, staff and parents.
Holyport College, sponsored by Eton College, accepts boarders and gives its pupils access to some of Eton's facilities.
During the visit, the royal couple met Sir Nicholas Winton, who lives near the school which has named its reception building after him.
Sir Nicholas, dubbed the "British Schindler", helped to save hundreds of children, mainly from Jewish families, from the Nazis by transporting them by train from Prague to the UK in 1939.
The wheelchair-bound 105-year-old said: "I think it's a wonderful honour to have the building named after me.
"I hope the school will make contact with a school in the Czech Republic that is also named after me."
Other guests included Home Secretary Theresa May, MP for Maidenhead.
The school was proposed in February 2012 and then approved by the Department for Education through the free schools programme in June 2012.
Once it reaches capacity, the school will have 500 pupils, including 225 boarders aged 11-19 years.
Parents pay £3,850 a term for boarders but daytime education is free.

===Input Doc/Src: It looked at progress in England following the introduction of a £5.3bn Better Care Fund to help local authorities invest in services to keep patients out of hospital.
It says in its first year, the fund has helped join up health and social care.
But it hasn't led to the expected reduction in hospital workload.
The Department of Health said it was too soon to judge the Fund's impact.
According to the NAO, within the first year of the Better Care Fund being introduced:
A week of coverage by BBC News examining the state of the NHS across the UK as it comes under intense pressure during its busiest time of the year.
The total Better Care Fund budget for 2015-16 was £5.3bn (some local authorities added extra money to the £3.8bn earmarked by the government).
It was hoped the Fund would return a saving of around £500m in its first year by reducing demand for costly hospital care.
Using the Fund, local authorities had estimated they could cut emergency hospital admissions by 106,000. Instead, they went up by 87,000, compared to the previous year.
The number of delayed transfers of care cases - when a patient is healthy enough to leave the hospital but is unable to do so - was meant to drop by 293,000. It went up by 185,000.
The NAO report says cash flow worries are mounting in both health and social care and it remains unclear whether more integration of services will help.
It says the government should take stock and evaluate how best to move forward.
The Department of Health says it wants to make care even more joined-up.
Sir Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office, said: "Integrating the health and social care sectors is a significant challenge in normal times, let alone times when both sectors are under such severe pressure. So far, benefits have fallen far short of plans, despite much effort."

===Input Doc/Src: The force of the blast shook buildings several miles away.
SpaceX said "an anomaly" had occurred while the rocket was being loaded with fuel. No-one was injured, it said.
The rocket's payload, an  Israeli-built communications satellite for Facebook due to launch on Saturday, was also destroyed, it added.
Facebook, in partnership with Eutelsat Communications, had been due to use the Amos-6 satellite to deliver broadband internet coverage for swathes of sub-Saharan Africa as part of its Internet.org initiative.
Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who is currently visiting Africa, said he was "deeply disappointed" to hear that the satellite had been destroyed.
"We remain committed to our mission of connecting everyone, and we will keep working until everyone has the opportunities this satellite would have provided," he wrote on his Facebook account.
A leading Israeli space official said the loss of the Amos-6 satellite, valued at more than $200m (Â£150m) and owned by Spacecom, was a major blow to the industry.
"As far as the Israeli communications satellite industry is concerned, this is a very severe blow which could place the future of the industry in doubt if it is not dragged out of the mud," said the chairman of the  Israel Space Agency, Isaac Ben-Israel.
SpaceX rocket explodes on launch pad
Cape Canaveral Air Force Station said a "significant" explosion had happened just after 09:00 (14:00 GMT) at Launch Complex 40, which is leased by SpaceX.
SpaceX said in a statement: "The anomaly originated around the upper stage oxygen tanks and occurred during propellant loading of the vehicle.

"As per standard operating procedure, all personnel were clear of the pad and no-one was injured. We are continuing to review the data to identify the root cause."

===Input Doc/Src: The senior brother had previously been moved out of Rubane House, where he abused young boys, and became principal of a school in Downpatrick.
The details were revealed at the Historical Institutional Abuse (HIA) Inquiry.
It is examining allegations of abuse at Rubane House in Kircubbin.
About 200 former residents have made allegations of abuse.
The inquiry also heard the De La Salle Religious Order paid compensation to victims who were sexually abused at Rubane House within years of the order ruling that a previous investigation into their abuser was "best forgotten".
The HIA has been told that one victim, then aged 12, arrived at Rubane House in 1961.
Three years earlier, in 1958, the order launched an internal inquiry into claims of sex abuse against the brother in charge of the home.
The order subsequently ruled that "no reference is to be made at any time or to anyone regarding the inquiry".
However, the senior brother continued to sexually abuse boys at the home. The order later paid the victim £27,500 in compensation.
Another victim, who was in the home from 1958 to 1960, was paid £20,000 in compensation earlier this year.
Junior counsel to the inquiry, Joseph Aiken, opted not to read out the contents of a statement the man made to police in 2010.
Mr Aiken invited the inquiry panel to adjourn to take time to read the statement which he described as "graphic".
The inquiry also heard the victim "subsequently abused his own children".
Rubane House was open from 1950 to 1985.
A total of 55 former residents have come forward to the inquiry to allege that they were physically or sexually abused.
The sex abuse allegations at Rubane House ranged from watching children in the shower to rape, while physical abuse ranged from corporal punishment to serious assault.
The HIA inquiry was set up in 2013 to investigate child abuse in residential institutions in Northern Ireland over a 73-year period, up to 1995.

Nollaigh O'Neill, who led from early on, dominated the women's race.
"I'm so happy, but the time was slow," said the 44-year-old Irish runner.
"I was flying up until about mile 20 or 21 and my quads started to seize and tighten up, so I just had to pull back and run strong and smart."
O'Neill made it over the line at the Weighbridge just outside the three hour mark (3:01.48) and more than 10 minutes clear of second-placed Ffion Davies.
More than 400 runners took on the full 26-mile course, with hundreds more in the 3K fun run and relay events.
While Troshkin stole the headlines in the men's race, Faudemer's run smashing quarter of an hour off his personal best was amongst the local highlights.
"I'm just so happy," Faudemer told BBC Radio Jersey.
"Long distance running is picking up in Jersey - I knew I had it in me with the sessions I've done in the build up.
"The support was amazing throughout the whole course, friends and family, it was awesome and made a big difference."

===Input Doc/Src: Parents are only allowed to take children out of school in "exceptional circumstances" or face fines.
Bishop Bronescombe C of E School in St Austell, Cornwall, is creating the extra week at the end of the May half-term holiday.
Cornwall Council said it was up to schools to plan their inset days.
Changes to the law, which came into force on 1 September, mean head teachers no longer have the discretion to grant authorised leave to pupils each year.
The new rules are aimed at preventing children missing vital parts of their education, which the the Department for Education (DfE) said can have a "hugely damaging effect".
But some parents have said they cannot afford to pay the premium prices travel companies charge during official school holidays.
The head of school at Bishop Bronescombe, Katie Dalton, said it would be putting the five teacher training days together in the summer term.
"Lots of our parents are low wage earners, which is typical in Cornwall, and also they are seasonal workers, which makes it very difficult for them to get a family holiday together, that is actually affordable.
"By putting the inset days all together in the summer term, it means they can take advantage of better deals and prices and it improves our attendance figures as well because there are less requests for leave during term time," she said.
Deborah Smith, who has two children at the school, welcomed the move.
"They said they understood lots of the parents down here are seasonal workers and they understand about the current economical climate and that budgets are tight for families, so I thought that was really important that the school were acknowledging and recognising the difficulty of paying for holidays," she said.
In a statement the DfE said: "Poor attendance at school can have a hugely damaging effect, and children who attend school regularly are nearly four times more likely to achieve five or more good GCSEs than those who are regularly absent.

===Input Doc/Src: South and West Yorkshire would both control some tax and spending if local councils devolve powers to new combined authorities run by a mayor.
Under the proposals, strategic planning, transport and economic regeneration powers would be handed over.
The Chancellor, George Osborne, could announce the plan on Wednesday.
The five West Yorkshire councils - Bradford, Calderdale, Kirklees, Leeds and Wakefield - joined the neighbouring City of York in North Yorkshire to form a combined authority six months ago.
Barnsley, Doncaster, Rotherham and Sheffield councils have created a similar South Yorkshire body.
The existing councils would continue to run services such as education and waste management individually.
Under the current agreement one of the council leaders is chosen by the others to chair the combined authority.
The chancellor's idea takes this on much further with extra powers for the combined authority to control social welfare policy, raise tax and control public spending. In return leadership would be given to a new generation of "metro mayors" wielding considerable executive powers.
Councillor Peter Box, Labour leader of Wakefield City Council and current chair of the West Yorkshire Combined Authority, said he would welcome any extra power and budgets but totally reject a regional executive mayor.
Wakefield, Bradford, Leeds and Sheffield all rejected individual city mayors in referendums just two years ago.
"Just a couple of weeks ago the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg was in Leeds and told us that we could have the devolved powers without having to accept an executive mayor," said Mr Box.
"Go on any street and it becomes clear the public will simply not accept another elected politician."
Andrew Carter, leader of the opposition Conservative Group on Leeds City Council, voted against creating a local executive mayor in the 2012 referendums.

All 151 passengers were evacuated and flights were suspended for three hours.
A backpack belonging to the men was blown up by police.
A spokesman for Cologne-Bonn airport confirmed the landing, adding: "Prior to this, the pilot had been informed about a suspicious conversation on board, after which he decided to make an unscheduled landing in Cologne-Bonn.
"After the safe landing... the 151 passengers left the [aircraft] via emergency slides and were taken to a transit gate."
The passengers had to "undergo a check immediately" and additional security checks were carried out on the plane.
A statement from Cologne police said other passengers had made the crew aware of a conversation by three men.
It said the subject had been "terrorist content", without elaborating further.
It added that federal police had "blown up in a controlled manner" a backpack belonging to the men.
Easyjet said the captain had taken the decision to land as a precaution to allow additional security checks to take place.

===Input Doc/Src: But Mr Obama said those who looted and started fires on Monday "should be treated like criminals".
The rioting came after the funeral of Freddie Gray, a black man fatally injured in police custody in Baltimore.
A week-long curfew has been announced and thousands of troops have been deployed to the city.
The National Guard has been sent to Baltimore to stop unrest for the first time since 1968, when some of the city's neighbourhoods went up in flames after the assassination of the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr.
On Tuesday evening, hundreds of protesters took to the streets to express their frustration with what they see as excessive police force.
The peaceful demonstrations were a contrast to the day before, when about 200 people were arrested as more than 100 cars were set alight and 15 buildings destroyed.
Mr Obama harshly criticised "a handful of people" for "senseless violence and destruction".
"That is not a protest, that is not a statement, they are stealing."
But the US president said the rioting had distracted from the frustration over Gray's death.
"This has been a slow-rolling crisis. This has been going on for a long time. This is not new. And we shouldn't pretend that it's new," Mr Obama said.
He added such problems would not be solved just by changes to policing.
"It would require everybody saying this is important, this is significant, and that we don't just pay attention to these communities when a CVS burns and we don't just pay attention when a young man gets shot or has his spine snapped."
At an afternoon briefing, Baltimore Captain Eric Kowalczyk was asked why the police had not responded with more resources to prevent fires and rioting.
He said police had originally deployed for a "high school event", expecting young students.
"I don't think there's anyone in the country that would expect us to deploy automatic weapons and armoured vehicles to an event with 13, 14 and 15 year olds," but saw it turned into an incident that drew in older troublemak

The south and centre have been placed on red alert because of the floods, which have claimed several lives.
In 2000, 700 people died and half a million were made homeless in Mozambique's worst flooding on record.
The worst affected areas are in the southern Gaza province, where a number of rivers are currently above crisis levels.
Emergency teams are on stand-by and motorboats have been dispatched to help transport people to safety, the AFP news agency reports. The evacuees will be brought to temporary shelters. Some of them have been set up in the capital, Maputo.
"We estimate there are 55,000 people affected," Rita Almeida from Mozambique's Disaster Relief Management Institute told AFP.
The town of Chokwe, home to a dyke, is particularly vulnerable, she added.
"We are registering very high water levels in the Limpopo and Inkomati rivers that could flood the town," Ms Almeida said.
From Sunday to Monday, almost 185mm (7 inches) of rain fell over the Limpopo basin, the AFP reports.
International observers have described the situation as critical. There are fears that the dyke in Chokwe could break, which would lead to chaos in the evacuations.
"If that dyke breaks, all those people will have to move more rapidly," the country chief of the World Food Programme, Lola Castro, said.

===Input Doc/Src: Health Minister Recep Akdag was quoted by the Anadolu news agency as saying traces of one of the decomposition products of Sarin had been detected in the blood and urine of several victims.
At least 89 people were killed in the incident in rebel-held Khan Sheikhoun.
Syria's government has repeatedly denied using any chemical weapons.
The US has rejected the assertion, however, and on Friday it carried out a missile strike on the Shayrat airbase, where it said a Syrian Air Force jet that attacked Khan Sheikhoun with chemical weapons took off.
President Bashar al-Assad's ally Russia, which says the Syrian jet had in fact hit a rebel depot full of chemical munitions, denounced the "illegal action" by the US.
A number of casualties were treated at hospitals in Turkey, which opposes Mr Assad, following last Tuesday's incident in neighbouring Idlib province.
The World Health Organization said their apparent lack of external injuries and similar symptoms, including acute respiratory distress, suggested they had been exposed to organophosphorus chemicals, a category that includes nerve agents.
On Tuesday, Mr Akdag announced that a chemical known as isopropyl methyphosphonic acid (IMPA) had been "identified in the blood and urine tests conducted on samples taken from the victims".
Once exposed to air and water, Sarin breaks down into IMPA and methylphosphonic acid (MPA).
The UN concluded that rockets filled with sarin were fired at several rebel-held suburbs of Damascus in August 2013 after finding traces of IMPA in samples taken from the scene of the attack, which the US blamed on Syria's government.

Mendes directed 2012's Skyfall and the forthcoming Bond film, titled Spectre.
"I don't think I could go down that road again," he said. "You do have to put everything else on hold."
Spectre, in which Daniel Craig will make his fourth appearance as the MI6 agent, will come out on 26 October in the UK and 6 November in the US.
Spectre and Skyfall took a total of five years to make, he told BBC Radio's Test Match Special.
"It feels almost, even though we've just finished shooting it, like one big experience and it was a fantastic life-changing thing," he said. But he added he did not think he could go through it again.
"It really is more a lifestyle choice than a job," he said.
Mendes made his name in theatre, and directed a new stage production of Roald Dahl's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory in between making the Bond films.
But shooting a Bond movie is "pretty much all encompassing", he explained.
"I'm happiest rehearsing a play or editing a movie, and when I've finished editing a movie I generally want to be back in a theatre environment again," he said.
"It feels like home, it feels controllable after the chaos of a movie set. But it won't be long before I want to do another film, and I'm very fortunate to be able to go back and forth between the two."

Drugs tests carried out on a substance found around some of the UN vehicles were negative, the police said.
The vehicles were allowed to be reloaded on board before the ship left, but the police have retained the arms.
The rifles and rocket-propelled grenades, which were among the weapons found inside the UN vehicles, would be delivered under Kenyan escort to Indian peacekeepers in DR Congo, Mombasa County police commander Francis Wanjohi said.
He said it would be too dangerous for the MV Hoegh Transporter to continue its journey if it was common knowledge there were weapons aboard, because of the threat of piracy.
The ship had been sailing from Mumbai in India, but its final destination is unknown.
The BBC's Ferdinand Omondi in Mombasa says the dramatic midnight raid on the vessel after it had docked on Thursday night involved several elite Kenya police units, including the narcotics squad and the criminal investigation department.
The whole port was shut down and people asked to leave as it searched the ship, he says.
The UN's Nairobi office said the misunderstanding over the weapons, often stored in vehicles for to avoid damage in transit, was down to a clerical error.
It said although the weapons were not declared in the manifest, a separate declaration accompanying the military vehicles was attached.
A UN spokesman further explained new vehicles often had anti-humidity powder put around tyres for long shipments.
Hoegh Autoliners, the owners of the ship, were contemplating suing the state for damages and defamation, a lawyer representing them in Kenya, said.

===Input Doc/Src: The US Anti-Doping Agency (Usada) said the 35-year-old failed to provide details of his whereabouts for testing on three occasions within 18 months.
He will be stripped of any result he achieved from 17 November, 2012, the date of his third failure to comply.
Gold: 2004 Olympic 200m, 2001 World Indoor Championships 200m
Silver: 2008 Olympic 200m, 2004 Olympic 4x100m relay, 2004 World Indoor Championships 60m
Bronze: 2001 World Championships 200m
But his agent said Crawford retired after missing out on London 2012.
Crawford failed to qualify for last year's Olympics after finishing seventh in the US trials final.
"He's 35 years of age, and has moved on," his representative Kimberly Holland told Reuters.  "Unfortunately, his announcement wasn't enough, as he had to complete retirement paper work to be removed from the testing pool."
Crawford also won silver in the 200m and the 4x100m relay at the Beijing Olympics.
When Usain Bolt won the first of his Olympic 200m titles in 2008, Crawford originally finished fourth, but was given the silver medal after Wallace Spearmon and Churandy Martina of Netherlands Antilles were disqualified for running out of their lanes.
Crawford later gave his medal to Martina, who would have been the first Olympic medallist from his country.
In 2003, he took part in a US television programme that saw him race against a zebra and a giraffe. He beat the giraffe but lost twice to the zebra after demanding a rematch following a false start.
Crawford won the Olympic 200m title in 2004, clocking a personal best of 19.79 seconds to defeat compatriots Bernard Williams and Justin Gatlin.
Usada said his ban would begin from 17 April, the date he received the sanction.

===Input Doc/Src: A museum in New Zealand has made an official approach to Hawick museum for the flag, taken from a Maori tribe by Crown forces during a battle in 1865.
The bid is supported by descendents of key figures involved in the Battle of Omaruhakeke.
Members of Scottish Borders Council will be asked to approve the move.
The request for the flag by Wairoa Museum in Hawke's Bay on New Zealand's North Island was accompanied by four letters from descendents of Maori leaders.
They said the return of the flag could be a powerful symbol for the resolution of 160 years of social, economic, political and spiritual turmoil for the Maori people in that area of New Zealand.
Councillor Vicky Davidson has already said there was "no good reason" for the flag to be part of the local museum collection.
Scottish Borders Council's executive committee will decide whether or not to return the flag to New Zealand.

===Input Doc/Src: The Coptic Orthodox Church is one of Christianity's oldest, founded in Alexandria around 50 AD.
But since President Mohammed Morsi and his Muslim Brotherhood were removed from power by the military in early July, Islamist extremists have targeted Egypt's Christian minority, holding them partly responsible.
The Coptic Pope, Tawadros II, has received death threats, while several Christians have been killed.
At St Mark's Cathedral in Cairo on Sunday, dozens of children gathered for Bible study. Security at the gates was tight, after an attack there earlier this year.
Last Tuesday, 10-year-old Jessi Boulus was walking home from her Bible class in a working-class area of the capital when a gunman killed her with a single shot to the chest.
For Jessi's parents, the grief is still almost too raw for words. She was their only child. Both try but cannot hold back the tears as they describe their daughter.
Her mother, Phoebe, believes that she was targeted purely because she was Christian.
BBC Religion: Coptic Orthodox Church
"She was my best friend, my everything. Jessi was just becoming a young woman," she says. "Every woman dreams of becoming a mother, and for 10 years I was lucky enough to be a mum. I'll miss Jessi calling me mum - I know I won't ever hear it again."
Jessi's father, Boulus, veers between grief and despair, as he recalls the hatred that changed their lives forever.
"Jessi was everything to us. Her killers didn't know that Jessi was my life - my future. They killed our future. I lived for her. We both did," he says, unable to conceal his emotion.
The couple say that in recent months, Jessi had begun to worry about her own safety, aware of the tensions on the streets. The family had talked about emigrating, but made a conscious decision to remain in Egypt, their home.
Boulus, though, says that a climate of increasing intolerance created by Islamic fundamentalism led to his daughter's and other deaths.

===Input Doc/Src: Enrique is leaving after three years in charge at the Nou Camp.
Ibai Gomez hit the post for Alaves before Messi scored his 54th goal of the season with a 20-yard curler.
Theo Hernandez bent in a free-kick to equalise, but Neymar turned in from close range and then Messi played in Paco Alcacer right on half-time.
It has been a disappointing season for Barcelona, who finished runners-up to Real Madrid in La Liga and were eliminated from the Champions League by Juventus in the quarter-finals.
They did at least restore some pride with victory over last season's second division champions in what was the final match to be played at Atletico Madrid's Vicente Calderon Stadium.
There were some records set along the way as Enrique's team retained the trophy, having beaten Athletic Bilbao and Sevilla in the last two finals.
Messi, who struck the opener after exchanging passes with Neymar outside the penalty area, became the first player to score in four Copa finals since Athletic Bilbao's Telmo Zarra in 1950.
Neymar, who forced in Barcelona's second when Messi played in Andre Gomes to cross low from the right, is the first man to score in three successive Copa finals since Ferenc Puskas, who achieved the feat with Real Madrid between 1960 and 1962.
Messi's through pass for the third goal was sublime, and was finished calmly by Alcacer - who has been inconsistent since his move from Valencia last summer.
The one major worry for Barcelona was a nasty head injury to Javier Mascherano, who was carried off on a stretcher after an early collision with Marcos Llorente,
He suffered concussion as well as a cut to his head, and an injury to his right knee that will need further tests, the club said afterwards.
---Sum/Tgt: Lionel Messi was inspired as Barcelona beat Alaves to secure the Copa del Rey for the third year running and give coach Luis Enrique a winning send-off.

===Input Doc/Src: Alexander Beltran Herrera's unit was responsible for moving the hostages and imprisoning them in chains.
The contract workers were on an anti-drug surveillance mission when their aircraft broke down in the Colombian jungle in February 2003.
They were eventually rescued by the Colombian military in 2008.
Hostages Thomas Howes, Keith Stansell and Marc Gonsalves were imprisoned by members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) and held by Herrera's unit for around two years.
While Alexander Beltran Herrera did not have much contact with the hostages, the court heard how the three men were taken deep into the jungle and kept in chains for much of the five years of their captivity.
Keith Stansell removed his shirt to show the court scars around his neck from the chains and described being chained to a tree whilst suffering from malaria.
But, addressing Herrera, he said: "I don't want him to suffer like we did."
Herrera was extradited to the United States in 2012.  His lawyer described him as a man of little education who had been trying to build a new life after he deserted from the Farc in 2009.
According to Associated Press, he apologised to the men during the trial, saying: "I feel shamed about what you all had to go through.''
Colombian military forces rescued the three Americans in July 2008 in a high profile helicopter rescue operation, which also brought about the release of French-Colombian politician Ingrid Betancourt, as well as 10 other hostages.
The Farc are currently engaged in dialogue with the Colombian authorities in a bid to negotiate a peace deal - some see it as the best chance for a negotiated settlement since the guerrilla group launched its armed struggle in 1964.

===Input Doc/Src: Glasgow City Council confirmed Harry Clarke had been suspended following evidence at the ongoing inquiry into the tragedy, which killed six people.
The inquiry has heard Mr Clarke, 58, previously fainted while working as a bus driver but failed to disclose the incident when he joined the council.
It has also heard a claim Mr Clarke "lied through his teeth" to doctors.
A spokesman for the council confirmed that it had suspended Mr Clarke on a precautionary basis pending a full disciplinary investigation.
He added: "A number of allegations have been made during the enquiry in regard to Mr Clarke's conduct before and at the point where he commenced employment with the council.
"These allegations have yet to be put to Mr Clarke and he has not yet had the opportunity of responding to them. The internal investigation will therefore take place at the conclusion of the fatal accident inquiry".
The fatal accident inquiry (FAI) at Glasgow Sheriff Court has previously heard evidence that Mr Clarke had suffered episodes of dizziness and fainting for decades before the fatal crash on 22 December, when several witnesses reported seeing him slumped behind the wheel on the bin lorry as it went out of control in the city centre.
But he failed to disclose his health history to the DVLA and on job application forms, and was said to have continued to deny any history of blackouts even after the bin lorry crash.
In April 2010 - shortly before he joined the council - Mr Clarke fainted on a stationary bus while working as a driver for First Bus.
The FAI has heard claims that Mr Clarke was "on his last legs" at the bus firm following repeated sick days prior to his blackout.
Paramedics examined him on the bus and he refused to accompany them to hospital, instead returning to the depot where he informed his managers about the blackout.
He visited Baillieston Health Centre and told his GP, Dr Gerard McKaig, that he fainted "at work, in canteen, hot environment, no warning signs".

===Input Doc/Src: The RT-branded box contains food packaged in laboratory bottles, such as Medonium honey - "med" being honey in Russian and Meldonium a performance-enhancing drugs taken by athletes.
There is also raspberry jam tagged "anabolic" in reference to steroids also banned in sports.
"Not everyone realised this was a humorous present from RT," the broadcaster said. It has consistently denied and ridiculed allegations of a state-sponsored doping programme in Russia.
One of the gift boxes was sent to Yulia Efimova, who won two swimming silver medals at the 2016 Rio Olympics.
A photo posted on Russia's leading social networking website VKontakte shows a smiling Efimova with test tubes and vials apparently containing food, such as jam, honey and condiments.
On its website, RT gave further details of its gift pack which it suggested had also been sent to other people.
The website carried a video from the Twitter account of blogger Evgeny Kozlov showing one of the kits being unpacked.
People from RT are "unbelievably creative", he said.
The kits also include cards said to be based on drawings by children from an orphanage.
"A New Year's card that you will never throw away," said Yulia Ostroukhova, apparently another recipient of the gift box.
"Very nice. Many thanks for the delicious Medonium, too," she said on Facebook.
It is not clear how many kits were produced or how many recipients there were.
In July, an investigation commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) said Russia's sports ministry "directed, controlled and oversaw" manipulation of urine samples provided by its athletes.
A number of Russian athletes were banned from competing at the Rio Olympics, but no blanket ban was imposed.
Another report later in the year alleged more than 1,000 Russians benefited from a doping cover-up between 2011 and 2015.
Russian officials have strongly denied there has been a state-sponsored doping programme.

They were made with "sustainability at their heart", say organisers.
The gold medals are free from mercury, the silver and bronze medals are made from 30% recycled materials, and half of the plastic in their ribbons is from recycled plastic bottles.
The designs feature laurel leaves - a symbol of victory in ancient Greece - surrounding the Rio 2016 logo, and organisers say they celebrate "the relationship between the strengths of Olympic heroes and the forces of nature".
In line with the ecological theme of the Games, the podiums on which the athletes will receive the medals are made from organic materials and have been designed to be reused as furniture after the Games.
There are 2,642 Paralympic medals: 877 gold, 876 silver and 889 bronze and each has a device inside that uses tiny steel balls to make a sound when they are shaken, allowing visually impaired athletes to identify the colour by increasing in volume from bronze to gold.
The bronze medals have 16 steel balls and make the lowest sound, the silver medals have 20 balls and the golds have 28, producing the loudest noise.
All of the medals also have the words 'Rio 2016 Paralympic Games' written on them in Braille.

"There were loads of people in the crowd all the way round, even in the really remote parts of the course, so I really enjoyed the race."
Councillor Mary Lea, from Sheffield City Council, said: "Although the route is undoubtedly a challenging one, the view from the top of Ringinglow Road across the Peak District is surely one of the best rewards any weary runner could hope for.

===Input Doc/Src: Ms Philbin has been honoured for her work in sparking young peoples' interest in working in science, technology and engineering.
She co-founded the TeenTech organisation, which holds events that introduce school children to technical and creative careers.
Ms Philbin has also had a long media career connected to science and tech.
Her broadcasting career began in the late 1970s when Ms Philbin  presented the pioneering BBC saturday morning children's show Multi-Coloured Swap Shop.
From there, she went on to work on the iconic BBC science show Tomorrow's World. During the eight years she worked on that programme, Ms Philbin was first to demonstrate many innovations including car navigation systems, fax machines and mobile phones.
More recently, Ms Philbin was a reporter on the BBC's Bang Goes The Theory science show, and has regularly appeared on other radio and TV programmes as an science expert.
In 2008, she helped to start the non-profit TeenTech organisation that aimed to give young people a realistic view of what it is like to work in jobs that have a high science, technology, engineering and mathematics component.
It regularly runs events that let school children talk to people that work in different technical sectors and lets them get a feel for the techniques, equipment and approaches used in those professions.
Ms Philbin said giving children an insight into the ways that innovation and advances occur was important because an increasing proportion of jobs revolved around competence in science, technology and maths.
It's hard to think of anyone in the last 30 years who has had quite such an impact on enthusing people - and in particular young people - about technology as Maggie Philbin.
People of my generation will remember her as the woman who introduced us to everything from sat-nav to digital cameras on Tomorrow's World.
But today she is doing amazing work to get teenagers thinking about learning technology skills through her TeenTech organisation.

===Input Doc/Src: There had been speculation the festival could be held elsewhere following remarks made earlier this year by founder Michael Eavis.
Eavis previously said he "didn't really want to have a year without a festival", and claimed the event could be held somewhere else in 2017 or 2018.
Tickets for next year's event go on sale in October, it has been confirmed.
In a statement on the Glastonbury Festival website, the organisers said: "We will be taking our next fallow year in 2018, in order to give the farm, the village and the festival team the traditional year off.
"There are no plans to hold an event at another location in 2018."
The music festival is held on the Eavis family's Worthy Farm in Somerset, south-west England, and traditionally takes a break every six years so as not to cause damage to the working fields.
The last fallow year was 2012.
In June, Eavis had told the BBC he was "talking to Longleat" as it was his "favourite site" for a new festival.
He had added that hosting it at Worthy Farm meant dealing with 22 different landowners, which "wasn't easy".
Next year's festival will take place from 21 to 25 June, with the first batch of tickets, for those buying coach packages, released on 6 October.
General tickets will be released three days later, at 09:00 BST on 9 October.
Last year's initial release of 120,000 tickets sold out in just over half an hour.

"If not the best coach in the world, he is one of the best."

I am surprised in that I think that is the one area of the pitch where they have enough options. Manchester City's attack has been sensational this season. Bernardo Silva is very similar to David Silva. I wouldn't let David Silva go, I think he's been tremendous.

Whirlpool said it has now repaired two-thirds of the machines affected.
And it has told the BBC that waiting times can be as little as one month.
Fires have been caused by excess fluff, which can catch on the heating element. On one occasion earlier this year, a machine, awaiting a repair, caused a huge tower block fire in west London which left families homeless and needed 120 firefighters to bring under control.
Some five million affected machines were sold in the UK, under the Creda, Indesit and Hotpoint brands, between April 2004 and September 2015.
Whirlpool has been undertaking a repair programme and offering discounted replacements to anyone with an affected dryer.
There has been criticism of the speed of these modifications and of the company's advice that the machines can still be used as long as they are not left unattended.
At times earlier in the year, there were cases of people being told they must wait well over a year for an engineer to visit.
Now Which? has criticised the company for call handlers quoting six to 12 weeks for customers to simply receive an ID number.
A customer ID number needed to be issued before anything could happen in the repair or replacement process, the consumer group said.
"It is absolutely unacceptable that one year on, Whirlpool customers are still seeing slow, poor service and potentially receiving incorrect and dangerous advice," said Alex Neill, from Which?.
"Its modification programme is clearly not progressing as fast as it should."
However Whirlpool said it was making good progress with repairs.

===Input Doc/Src: The BBC found a disregard for health and safety on an estate in north-east India owned by Assam Company.
The Rainforest Alliance, an ethical certification organisation, has now stripped a group of Assam Company's plantations of its green frog seal.
The Assam Company said it was appealing against the decision. A group of Assam Company's estates lost its certification because "it was found to be in breach of critical criteria relating to the use of personal protective equipment", the Rainforest Alliance said in a statement.
The Assam Company said the loss of its certification was because of a "minor error" on one estate - Hajua - while spraying a plant extract, which it understood did not require personal protective equipment. It said that because the Assam company estates operate in a "single cluster", the other estates were automatically decertified.
Twinings, Taylors of Harrogate and Fortnum & Mason have suspended business with the company while Harrods took the tea off its shelves shortly after the investigation, which was broadcast in September.
Workers at the company's Hajua estate were seen spraying agrochemicals without the protective equipment employers are required to provide, when the BBC visited.
Men spraying reported breathing difficulties, numbness of the hands and face, a burning sensation on the skin and profound loss of appetite.
The Rainforest Alliance said its auditor confirmed the BBC's evidence of unsafe spraying and the organisation had tightened its rules on the subject.
Taylors of Harrogate said it will maintain a relationship with the estates and support efforts to improve standards.
Twinings plans to continue working with the Ethical Tea Partnership (ETP) - an organisation set up by UK tea companies to improve workers' lives - to monitor the working and living conditions on all the tea estates from which it buys.

The Mail on Sunday also reported Lord Hall and his wife were under 24-hour protection from security guards at their Oxfordshire home.
The Met said the email appeared to have been sent from outside the UK.
"Police in Westminster are investigating an allegation of threats to kill," a Met spokesman said.
"The allegation was reported to police on Wednesday, 25 March.  The threat was made by email."
He said inquiries were continuing to establish from where the email was sent.
No arrests have been made.
A BBC spokeswoman said: "We wouldn't comment on security matters."
Lord Hall announced his decision not to renew Clarkson's contract on Wednesday - after an internal inquiry found the presenter had subjected producer Oisin Tymon to an "unprovoked physical and verbal attack" at a North Yorkshire hotel.
Mr Tymon, who suffered a split lip, did not file a formal complaint and it is understood Clarkson reported himself to BBC bosses following the incident, and was suspended.
The row - which took place on 4 March - was said to have occurred because no hot food was provided following a day's filming.
Lord Hall said he had not taken his decision lightly, but insisted "a line has been crossed".
More than a million people signed an online petition to reinstate Clarkson.
The Mail claimed the death threats were made to Lord Hall via email the same day as his announcement.
It also published photographs of security guards outside his home.
Mr Tymon, who previously described Clarkson as a "unique talent", has himself come under sustained abuse on social media for his involvement in the dispute.

===Input Doc/Src: His spokesman says Khodorkovsky and his wife travelled by train to Basel from Germany to accompany their two sons who are returning to their Swiss school.
Khodorkovsky flew to Germany after his release on 20 December.
He served 10 years in jail for fraud and tax evasion, but insists that his conviction was politically motivated.
While travelling to Basel on Sunday, Khodorkovsky told Swiss TV he wanted to campaign for the release of prisoners.

"You can't remain quiet when you know that political prisoners languish in jail," he said.
"I think campaigning for the release of those who have been jailed without justification is the job of every ordinary citizen. As far as I'm concerned, it has nothing to do with politics," he added.
Khodorkovsky has not yet decided whether he wants to stay permanently in Switzerland, his spokesman said.
The businessman made his fortune from the controversial privatisation of Soviet state assets. In 1995, he acquired oil giant Yukos.
After President Vladimir Putin came to power Khodorkovsky made no secret of his support for the liberal opposition,
In 2005 he received an eight-year jail sentence for tax evasion, fraud and embezzlement. Two years before his release date he was convicted again on further charges of embezzlement and money laundering.
He had been due to be released next August, but requested a pardon because his mother is suffering from cancer.
The pardon came after Russian MPs backed a wide-ranging amnesty for at least 20,000 prisoners.
Two members of punk protest band Pussy Riot - jailed for staging a protest in a cathedral - have also recently been freed.
Analysts say Mr Putin may have been trying to dampen international criticism of Russia's human rights record ahead of February's Winter Olympics in Sochi.

===Input Doc/Src: On Monday, Prime Minister David Cameron said Crewe could lose HS2 investment in a post-election Labour-SNP deal.
But SNP deputy leader Stewart Hosie described the comments as "utterly meaningless" and "preposterous".
Crewe's Labour candidate Adrian Heald said he would "not support any move to jeopardise the HS2 line at Crewe".
A report last year into the route of the high-speed rail line running north from London recommended a new station be built in Crewe.
But Mr Cameron said a minority Labour government, backed by the SNP, means schemes could be dropped.
The prime minister said projects linked to HS2 that could be jettisoned include Crewe's planned University Technical College and the Railway Exchange Training Academy.
Also speaking on Monday, Chancellor George Osborne said: "The SNP deputy leader has said in the last couple of days, if there was a minority Labour administration that needed SNP help to get their legislation through 'we might well say let's not have HS2 go to Manchester and Birmingham, let's have it start in Edinburgh and Glasgow'.
"That is tearing up the plan for huge investment in Crewe. That is cancelling the thousands of jobs and businesses that will come to this town.
"That is a billion pound blow to Crewe and is the price tag of voting for Labour and Ed Miliband here."
While Labour has ruled out a coalition with the SNP, Scottish nationalists for their part have said they could support a minority Labour government on an "issue-by-issue" basis.
Echoing the SNP's manifesto, Mr Hosie said he would like to see a Scottish section of HS2 built "at the same time" as the first phase planned between London and the West Midlands, allowing the line to "meet in the middle" of the country.
"Why would that put investment in Crewe at risk?" he said.
"What would put Crewe investment at risk is the Â£30bn cuts presented by Cameron and friends."
Meanwhile, Labour candidate Mr Heald said: "HS2 is the best opportunity to generate prosperity in Crewe and South Ch
---Sum/Tgt: Conservative claims that Labour and the Scottish National Party (SNP) could reduce high-speed rail investment in Crewe have been dubbed "preposterous".

A Syrian official has insisted it would "never, under any circumstances" use such weapons, "if such weapons exist".
Meanwhile, the United Nations says it is pulling "all non-essential international staff" out of Syria.
As many as 25 out of 100 international staff could leave this week, the UN news agency Irin reported, while all humanitarian missions outside Damascus will be halted for the time being.
In a speech on nuclear non-proliferation at the National Defense University in Fort McNair, Mr Obama said: "We've worked to keep weapons from spreading, whether it was nuclear material in Libya or nor chemical weapons in Syria.

Could US remove Syria chemical weapons?
"We simply cannot allow the 21st century to be darkened by the worse weapons of the 20th century."
"And today I want to make it absolutely clear to Assad and anyone who is under his command... If you make the tragic mistake of using these weapons there will be consequences and you will be held accountable."
But Damascus rejected allegations it was preparing to use such weapons.
A foreign ministry spokesman was quoted by state television as saying: "Syria confirms repeatedly it will never, under any circumstances, use chemical weapons against its own people, if such weapons exist."
Syria is believed to hold chemical weapons - including mustard gas and sarin, a highly toxic nerve agent - at dozens of sites around the country.
The CIA has said those weapons "can be delivered by aircraft, ballistic missile, and artillery rockets".
One unnamed US official spoke to the New York Times of "potential chemical weapon preparation".

"He'll come into the squad if his clearance [comes] through" said player-manager Andy Morrell.
Artell has not played since October because of an Achilles injury.
Despite his lack of games and with centre-half Martin Riley out with a hamstring injury, Morrell has not ruled out Artell starting should he eligible in time.
"He hasn't played a game for a while but he's a good pro. He knows what to do, where to be on the pitch," Morrell added.
Another midweek loan signing, striker Dele Adebola is available to make his debut after being granted international clearance.
Wrexham will be without midfielder Jay Harris who has been handed a four-match suspension following his red card at Barrow.
"We're going to miss Jay Harris for four games. It was a bit of a foolish thing to do with the state of the game," Morrell said.

===Input Doc/Src: Taylor is out of contract in the summer and has been linked with West Brom, Middlesbrough and Crystal Palace.
The 23-year-old pulled out of the 1-1 draw with Wigan as Leeds failed to reach the Championship play-offs.
"I'm hugely disappointed with Charlie. I think he's been terribly advised all season," Monk told BBC Radio Leeds.
Taylor has been with Leeds since the age of nine and has made 104 first-team appearances since his debut in August 2011.
However, he told the club last summer he did not want to open talks on a new deal and then had a transfer request rejected.
Monk suggested Taylor's head had been turned by the interest reportedly shown in him from Premier League clubs.
"I understand he's very young, and we've tried to help him and guide him from within, but it's very difficult to get him fully committed," he said.
"Had he had some better advice from the outside, I think we would have seen a better Charlie Taylor this season and left on better terms, if that's what's going to happen. But that's over to the club and the player now.
"The club's stance on it is very strong. Hopefully he learns from the mistake he's made."

===Input Doc/Src: Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt had called for the system to be simplified to help "turbocharge" tourism in the wake of the London 2012 Olympics.
But a letter seen by the Daily Telegraph suggests Theresa May believes it would pose a security threat.
The letter, written by Mrs May's private secretary, says she believes the plan is "unacceptable".
On Tuesday, Mr Hunt set out a strategy to give UK tourism a boost following London's Games and said ministers were looking at simplifying visa applications for non-EU nationals.
The strategy focused on attracting visitors from China, where the government thinks there is potential to triple the number of tourists - generating more than Â£500m in extra spending and creating more than 14,000 jobs.
Currently, visitors can apply for a single visa to visit much of Europe - but a separate one is required to travel to the UK.
Countries such as France and Germany are far more successful at attracting Chinese visitors, and the UK could do better if getting a visa was easier, Mr Hunt has suggested.
But a letter from Mrs May's private secretary to the prime minister's private secretary said the current rules were a "key tool in protecting the public against significant harm".
There are already 400 Chinese criminals awaiting deportation and 1,000 asylum applications from Chinese citizens last year, it said.
"The proposal... is not acceptable to the home secretary for national security reasons," the letter said.
"We also face significant challenges with foreign national offenders and organised crime, including drugs, money laundering, fraud, criminal finances, intellectual property, immigration and cyber crime."
But Mark Tanzer, chief executive of the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta), said: "In the absence of concrete data about visa abuse, it is impossible to determine whether the right balance is being struck between the UK's commercial interests and its security needs."
He argued that "proper visa monitoring and reporting proc

Kerber, seeded seventh, won a thrilling final 6-4 3-6 6-4 at Melbourne Park.
The 28-year-old is the first German to win a major singles title since Steffi Graf at the 1999 French Open.
Williams, 34, was beaten for just the fifth time in 26 Grand Slam finals, and the American missed the chance to tie Graf's open-era record of 22 titles.
Kerber, who saved a match point in her first-round win over Misaki Doi, will move up to number two in the world rankings.
Kerber had won just one of six previous matches against Williams and was making her Grand Slam final debut, but she was the better player over two hours and eight minutes on Rod Laver Arena.
She led Williams in the ace count until the latter stages, limiting her to just seven overall, while the American racked up 46 errors to just 13 by Kerber.
Williams made 23 mistakes in the first set alone - sparking memories of her desperately nervous display in losing to Roberta Vinci at the US Open last September - and Kerber took full advantage to claim it after 39 minutes.
However, the defending champion cut her error count to just five in the second set and claimed it thanks to a single break in game four.
Kerber twice moved ahead in the decider and a stunning sixth game saw the German produce two fine drop shots and win a breathtaking 19-stroke rally to cling on to her serve and edge closer to victory.
Nerves took hold and she was broken while serving for the match, but she launched into the Williams serve once again and clinched the title when the world number one sent a volley long.
Kerber said afterwards that being able to say she was a Grand Slam champion "sounds crazy".
"It's my dream come. I worked for this my whole life," said the German.
"It's been such an up and down two weeks, I was match point down in the first round and had one foot in the plane to Germany.

===Input Doc/Src: The hosts were closest to scoring in a cagey first half as Peter Whittingham's thunderous long-range shot hit the bar.
Gunnarsson won it for Cardiff with a swerving first-time effort from 25 yards, though Apostolos Vellios almost equalised but also hit the woodwork.
Forest drop to 21st place in the Championship table, just one point above the bottom three.
Cardiff, meanwhile, climb up to 13th after a third successive home win.
A significant day at the foot of the Championship saw four of Forest's relegation rivals taking each other on, with Blackburn hosting Bristol City and Birmingham at home to Burton.
Perhaps mindful of how tight things were in the bottom half, Mark Warburton's side started a little apprehensively against Cardiff, who were the first to threaten with Whittingham's booming 30-yard shot which crashed against the crossbar.
Other than that and a powerful long-range effort from Forest's Mustapha Carayol, there was precious little in terms of scoring opportunities in the first half.
There was more entertainment near the dugout, where Cardiff assistant manager Kevin Blackwell and his opposite number David Weir had to be separated after frayed tempers almost led to a scuffle.
Forest appeared to harness that emotion at half-time, emerging after the restart with renewed vigour and attacking intent.
Carayol looked their likeliest source of a goal, unnerving the home defence with his direct and quick running.
Despite the visitors' improvement, it was Cardiff who made the breakthrough as Kadeem Harris' cross was only half-cleared, leaving the ball to bobble invitingly into the path of Gunnarsson, who unleashed a fierce first-time shot which swerved beyond Jordan Smith and into the far corner.
Forest rallied, with substitutes Vellios and Britt Assombalonga threatening - but the former wasted their best opportunity as his looping header bounced on to the bar, stretching their winless run away from home to 11 league games.
